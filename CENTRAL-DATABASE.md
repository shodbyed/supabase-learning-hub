ðŸ¤” Questions Before We Proceed
Do you want TanStack Query? (I highly recommend it - perfect for your use case)
Migration pace: All at once or incremental (I recommend incremental - start with auth/member data)
Should we keep /utils/\*Queries.ts or fully migrate to /api/queries/? (I recommend migrate)
Realtime integration: Keep current useRealtime hook or integrate with TanStack Query subscriptions?
