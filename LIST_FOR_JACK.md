# Task List for Jack

## 1. Revamp Navigation Bar
- Review and update the navigation bar design and functionality
- Ensure consistent styling and user experience

## 2. Fix App.tsx Navigation
- Remove or properly implement the commented-out `NavigationWrapper` component in `src/App.tsx`
- Clean up unused imports: `useLocation`, `NavBar`, `OperatorNavBar`
- This is causing TypeScript errors for unused declarations

## 3. Type System Architecture Review
- **Issue**: Over-abstraction with Pick<> types for single-record fetches
- **Context**: Using `Pick<Member, 'id' | 'name' | ...>` for individual member queries adds maintenance overhead without performance benefit
- **Question**: Should we grab full records (`select *`) for single-entity fetches and only use selective fetching for list queries where it matters?
- **Trade-off**: Simplicity vs explicit dependencies. At current scale, simplicity likely wins.
- **Files affected**: Message components (MemberForMessaging), various single-entity hooks
- **Decision needed**: Establish pattern for when to use selective vs full fetching

## 4. InfoButton Responsive Positioning
- **Issue**: InfoButton popups get cut off on small screens
- **Context**: The popup positioning logic in `/src/components/InfoButton.tsx` needs improvement for mobile
- **Problem**: On narrow screens, the popup can extend beyond viewport edges, causing horizontal scrolling or cut-off content
- **Solution needed**:
  - Make popups stay fully within viewport at all screen widths
  - At small widths, consider full-width or anchored-to-edge positioning
  - At larger widths, keep centered positioning
  - Prevent any content cutoff regardless of screen size
- **File**: `/src/components/InfoButton.tsx`

## 5. Add RLS Policies Before Production
- **CRITICAL**: Database currently has NO Row Level Security policies enabled
- **Risk**: Any authenticated user can access/modify any data
- **Tables affected**:
  - `organizations` - No RLS policies
  - `organization_staff` - No RLS policies
  - All other tables need review
- **Action needed**:
  - Add RLS policies to `organizations` table (staff can only see their orgs)
  - Add RLS policies to `organization_staff` table (staff management permissions)
  - Review all existing tables for proper RLS implementation
  - Test RLS policies thoroughly before production deployment
- **Status**: RLS intentionally disabled during development/testing
- **Priority**: MUST be completed before any production deployment

## 6. Remove .env from Git History
- **Issue**: `.env` file was previously committed to git before being added to `.gitignore`
- **Risk**: Secrets remain in git history even after adding to `.gitignore`
- **Action needed**:
  ```bash
  git rm --cached .env
  git commit -m "Remove .env from tracking"
  ```
- **Note**: This removes the file from git without deleting it locally
- **Priority**: Should be done before pushing to any public/shared repository
