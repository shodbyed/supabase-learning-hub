## 1. Refactor PlayerNameLink Component

**Branch needed:** `refactor-player-name-link`

**Problem:** The component has a messy prop interface - passing separate pieces (`playerId`, `playerName`) while also fetching data internally. This is the worst of both worlds.

**Current props:**
- `playerId` - required
- `playerName` - required (but also fetched internally)
- `className` - optional styling
- `onSendMessage` - never used
- `onReportUser` - never used
- `onBlockUser` - never used
- `customActions` - extension point

**Solution:** Pass the whole player record instead of pieces.

**New interface:**
```tsx
interface PlayerNameLinkProps {
  player: {
    id: string;
    first_name: string;
    last_name: string;
    user_id: string | null;  // null = placeholder
    email?: string | null;
    membership_paid_date?: string | null;
    starting_handicap_3v3?: number | null;
    starting_handicap_5v5?: number | null;
  };
  className?: string;
  customActions?: CustomAction[];
}
```

**Changes needed:**
1. Update `PlayerNameLink` to accept `player` prop instead of `playerId`/`playerName`
2. Remove unused callback props (`onSendMessage`, `onReportUser`, `onBlockUser`)
3. Remove internal fetch for `playerBasicData` (already have it from prop)
4. Remove internal fetch for `playerOperatorData` (already have it from prop)
5. Keep `isBlocked` fetch (that's user-specific, not player data)
6. Update all call sites to pass `player={player}` instead of `playerId={player.id} playerName={...}`

**Note on existing hooks:**
- `useMemberById(playerId)` already exists in `src/api/hooks/useCurrentMember.ts:166`
- It uses `queryKeys.members.detail(memberId)` and fetches the full member record
- Currently the component has TWO custom inline fetches (lines 93-108 and 118-131) that should just use the existing hook
- But if we pass the whole player record, we don't need ANY fetch - the parent already has the data

**Files to update:**
- `src/components/PlayerNameLink.tsx` - main component
- All files that use `<PlayerNameLink>` (search for usages)
