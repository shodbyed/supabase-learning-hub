## League Operator Philosophy

**Target Operators**: Bar owners, pool hall owners, or experienced players who want to start and run their own leagues with minimal effort.

**Low Barrier to Entry**: No formal vetting, certification, or approval processes required. Anyone with some league experience can start operating leagues.

**Experience-Based Approach**: Operators should have SOME league experience, but formal qualifications aren't required. Designed for people who ran leagues for years based on player experience and minimal guidance.

**Self-Service Platform**: Provides the professional tools and guidance that experienced operators wish they had when starting out, dramatically reducing the learning curve.

**BCA Integration Strategy**:
- **Current Status**: BCA is not involved - all leagues are independent/in-house
- **No Sanctioning Available**: Currently no way to create BCA-sanctioned leagues
- **Future Possibility**: IF BCA shows interest later, we could add:
  - BCA-sanctioned league option with dues and Fargo integration
  - Choice between sanctioned vs in-house leagues
  - National championship eligibility for sanctioned leagues
- **Philosophy**: Build the foundation first, prove the concept, then add BCA features if there's mutual interest

**Mission**: Empower independent league operators with professional-grade tools while maintaining simplicity and accessibility. This is what the founder wished he had when starting his 15-year league operation journey.
