# Messaging System Implementation Progress

## Overview

Building a real-time messaging system for league communications with support for:

- Direct messages (1-on-1)
- Auto-managed group chats (Team Chat, Captain's Chat)
- Season announcements (read-only broadcasts)

---

## System Architecture

### League Structure Understanding

- **Organization** = All encompassing entity for single operator(e.g., "Ed's BCA League")
- **League** = Ongoing entity (e.g., "9-Ball Tuesday")
- **Season** = Time period within league (e.g., "Spring 2025")
- **Team** = Group of players in a specific season

### Conversation Types

#### 1. Direct Messages

- User → User (1-on-1)
- Created manually via "New Message"
- Both can reply

#### 2. Team Chat (Auto-Created)

- All team members can send/receive
- Auto-created when season becomes 'active'
- Auto-managed membership (synced with team_players table)
- Use case: "I'll be late", "need a sub", coordination

#### 3. Captain's Chat (Auto-Created)

- All captains + league operator(s) for a season
- Everyone can reply (back-and-forth discussion)
- Auto-created when season becomes 'active'
- Replaces operator's phone group text
- Use case: Rule questions, scheduling, season coordination

#### 4. Season Announcements (Auto-Created)

- Operator → All current season players
- Read-only for players (cannot reply)
- Auto-created when season becomes 'active'
- Use case: Schedule changes, important league updates

### ✅ Phase 2: Database Schema (COMPLETED - 2025-01-19)

**Status**: Complete - All tables created with RLS policies and triggers

#### Tables to Create

##### 1. **`conversations` table**

Stores conversation metadata

```sql
CREATE TABLE conversations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),

  -- Conversation type
  type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (type IN ('direct', 'group', 'announcement', 'auto_team', 'auto_captains')),

  -- Auto-managed conversations
  auto_managed BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  scope TEXT, -- 'team' | 'season_players' | 'season_captains'
  scope_id UUID, -- team_id or season_id

  -- Display info
  title TEXT, -- null for direct messages, required for groups/announcements

  -- Metadata
  created_by UUID REFERENCES members(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  last_message_at TIMESTAMPTZ, -- for sorting conversations

  -- Indexes
  CONSTRAINT valid_auto_managed CHECK (
    (auto_managed = false) OR
    (auto_managed = true AND scope IS NOT NULL AND scope_id IS NOT NULL)
  )
);

CREATE INDEX idx_conversations_last_message ON conversations(last_message_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_conversations_scope ON conversations(scope, scope_id) WHERE auto_managed = true;
```

##### 2. **`conversation_participants` table**

Links users to conversations

```sql

  conversation_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES conversations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  member_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES members(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,

  -- Permissions
  can_reply BOOLEAN DEFAULT true, -- false for announcement recipients
  is_admin BOOLEAN DEFAULT false, -- can manage group (add/remove participants)

  -- Read tracking
  joined_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  last_read_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),

  -- Constraints
  UNIQUE(conversation_id, member_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_participants_conversation ON conversation_participants(conversation_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_participants_member ON conversation_participants(member_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_participants_unread ON conversation_participants(member_id, last_read_at);
```

##### 3. **`messages` table**

Stores actual messages

```sql
CREATE TABLE messages (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  conversation_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES conversations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  sender_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES members(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,

  -- Content
  content TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (LENGTH(content) <= 2000),

  -- Edit tracking
  edited BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  edited_at TIMESTAMPTZ,

  -- Timestamps
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),

  -- Soft delete (for moderation)
  deleted BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  deleted_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  deleted_by UUID REFERENCES members(id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_messages_conversation ON messages(conversation_id, created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_messages_sender ON messages(sender_id);
```

##### 4. **`blocked_users` table** (Phase 6, but add to schema now)

User blocking/muting

```sql
CREATE TABLE blocked_users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  blocker_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES members(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  blocked_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES members(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,

  -- Type of block
  type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (type IN ('block', 'mute')),
  -- block = cannot message, cannot see in search
  -- mute = no notifications, but can still read

  -- Metadata
  reason TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),

  UNIQUE(blocker_id, blocked_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_blocked_users_blocker ON blocked_users(blocker_id);
```

##### 5. **`user_reports` table** (Phase 6, but add to schema now)

User reporting for moderation

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_reports (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),

  description TEXT NOT NULL,

  -- Context (what triggered the report)
  context_type TEXT, -- 'message' | 'profile' | 'match'

  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_reports_status ON user_reports(status, created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_reports_reported ON user_reports(reported_id);
```

### 📋 Phase 3: Auto-Created Conversations (TODO)

**When does auto-creation happen?**

- When season status changes to 'active'
- Triggered by operator completing season setup

#### Auto-Create Logic

```typescript
// When season becomes active:
async function createSeasonConversations(seasonId: string) {
  // 1. Create "Season Announcements"
  const announcement = await createConversation({
    type: 'announcement',
    auto_managed: true,
    scope: 'season_players',
    scope_id: seasonId,
    title: '{Season Name} - Announcements',
    created_by: operator_id,
  });

  // Add all players as participants (can_reply = false)
  await addParticipantsFromSeason(announcement.id, seasonId, false);

  // 2. Create "Captain's Chat"
  const captainsChat = await createConversation({
    type: 'auto_captains',
    auto_managed: true,
    scope: 'season_captains',
    scope_id: seasonId,
    title: '{Season Name} - Captains & Operator',
    created_by: operator_id,
  });

  // Add all captains + operator (can_reply = true)
  await addCaptainsAndOperators(captainsChat.id, seasonId);

  // 3. Create Team Chats for each team
  const teams = await getTeamsForSeason(seasonId);
  for (const team of teams) {
    const teamChat = await createConversation({
      type: 'auto_team',
      auto_managed: true,
      scope: 'team',
      scope_id: team.id,
      title: team.team_name,
      created_by: operator_id,
    });

    // Add all team members (can_reply = true)
    await addTeamMembers(teamChat.id, team.id);
  }
}
```

## Technical Notes

### Realtime Capabilities

- **Free Tier**: 200 concurrent connections, 2GB monthly bandwidth
- **Setup**: Add tables to supabase_realtime publication
- **Usage**: Subscribe to INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE events
- **Cleanup**: Always unsubscribe when component unmounts

### Component Architecture

- Messages page = container component
- ConversationList, MessageView, NewMessageModal = presentational
- All components use shadcn/ui
- Mock data at top of files for easy replacement

### File Locations

- **Pages**: `/src/pages/Messages.tsx`
- **Components**: `/src/components/messages/`
- **Utilities**: `/src/utils/messageQueries.ts` (to be created)
- **Database**: `/database/` (SQL files to be created)
