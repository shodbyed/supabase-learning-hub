## Current Architecture Status

**üéØ Project Status**: League Operator Onboarding Complete - Building League Creation Tools

**üîê Authentication**: Complete system with all flows working
**üë§ Member Management**: Full profile system with editing, dues tracking
**üéØ League Operator Onboarding**: Complete application system with payment verification
**üé® Design System**: Consistent shadcn/ui + Tailwind implementation
**üèóÔ∏è Code Organization**: Reusable components, utility functions, proper validation
**üìä Database Ready**: Comprehensive console logging for all operations

## Next Development Phase

### **üöÄ IMMEDIATE: League Builder System**
**Components Needed:**
- League creation form (name, format, schedule, rules)
- Venue management (create/select venues for leagues)
- League settings configuration
- League operator dashboard

**User Flow:**
1. Approved operator logs in
2. Sees "Create New League" option
3. Configures league settings
4. Sets up venues and schedules
5. Publishes league for player enrollment

### **Future Phases**
- Player enrollment and team management
- Scheduling and match tracking
- Scoring and standings systems
- Tournament features

## Established Patterns & Architecture

### **Form System Patterns**
- Multi-step forms with progress tracking and validation
- **localStorage Persistence**: Automatic form state preservation using useLocalStorage hook
- Reusable components (ContactInfoExposure, VisibilityChoiceCard, InfoButton with labels)
- Progressive disclosure UX for complex options
- Real-time validation with clear error messaging
- Secure payment tokenization practices
- **Conditional Navigation**: Dynamic step flow based on user selections (custom season length)

### **Component Architecture**
- Utility functions in src/utils/ for business logic
- Validation schemas with Zod in src/schemas/
- Custom hooks for complex state management
- Reusable UI components with proper TypeScript interfaces
- Clean separation of concerns across files

### **Database Integration Strategy**
- Comprehensive console logging for all operations
- Structured data output for easy database integration
- Token-based security for sensitive information (payment)
- UI-first development with database operations clearly documented
- **League Name Generation**: Multiple formatted names for different user contexts

### **localStorage Persistence System (Production Implementation)**
- **useLocalStorage Hook**: Simple, reliable hook that mirrors useState API
- **Dual Persistence**: Both form data ('league-creation-wizard') and current step ('league-wizard-step')
- **Smart Initialization**: Reads localStorage on mount, falls back to defaults gracefully
- **Automatic Saving**: useEffect saves to localStorage on every state change
- **Complete Cleanup**: localStorage cleared on completion, cancellation, or manual clear
- **State Synchronization**: localStorage and React state always in perfect sync
- **Tested Architecture**: Debugged through multiple iterations to ensure reliability

### **League Naming Architecture (Optimized)**
- **Separate State Fields**: dayOfWeek, season, year calculated once when start date set
- **Display Values Stored**: gameType stores "8 Ball", "9 Ball", "10 Ball" directly (no conversion)
- **On-Demand Generation**: League name computed in preview, not constantly regenerated
- **Clean Template**: `${gameType} ${dayOfWeek} ${season} ${year} ${organization}${qualifier}`
- **Database Names**: Final formatted names generated only when needed for database operations
- **Performance**: No useEffect loops, no timing issues, no constant regeneration

### **UX Patterns**
- Role-based interface differences (member vs operator)
- Clear value proposition and onboarding flows
- Professional payment and security messaging
- Accessible form interactions with keyboard navigation
