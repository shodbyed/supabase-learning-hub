# Progress

## What Works

- Installed the Supabase client library (`@supabase/supabase-js`).
- Set up environment variables (`VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`).
- Created `supabaseClient.ts` to initialize the Supabase client.
- Verified the connection to Supabase with a test query.
- Created the Login UI with fields for email and password.
- Added the Login component to the app and displayed it on the screen.
- Implemented login logic using Supabase's `signInWithPassword` method.
- Successfully logged in with a registered user.
- Installed React Router DOM for navigation.
- Set up routing in the app using React Router.
- Modularized navigation into `NavBar` and `NavRoutes` components.
- Created a `Home` page with a link to the Login page.
- Verified that navigation between `/`, `/about`, and `/login` works as expected.

## What's Left to Build

- set the css to App.tsx to make the sight more generic
- Enhance the `Home` page with additional content or styling.
- Add authentication logic to protect certain routes (e.g., `/dashboard`).
- Create a secure page (e.g., dashboard) for logged-in users.
- Redirect users to a secure page (e.g., dashboard) after successful login.
- Add logout functionality and secure routes.

## Current Status

- Navigation is modularized and functional
- The 'Home' page is implemented and has a link to the login page

## Known Issues

- None identified at this stage.
