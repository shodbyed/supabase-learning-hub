# Progress

## What Works

- Installed the Supabase client library (`@supabase/supabase-js`).
- Set up environment variables (`VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`).
- Created `supabaseClient.ts` to initialize the Supabase client.
- Verified the connection to Supabase with a test query.
- Created the Login UI with fields for email and password.
- Added the Login component to the app and displayed it on the screen.
- Implemented login logic using Supabase's `signInWithPassword` method.
- Successfully logged in with a registered user.
- Installed React Router DOM for navigation.

## What's Left to Build

- Redirect users to a secure page (e.g., dashboard) after successful login.
- Add logout functionality and secure routes.

## Current Status

- Step 4 of the authentication login flow is complete.
- Preparing to set up navigation flow and secure routes.

## Known Issues
