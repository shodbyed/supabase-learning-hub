- **Best Practice Naming**: Database uses lowercase (`eight_ball`, `monday`), formatted for display
- **Division Field**: Renamed from "qualifier" for better clarity
- **RLS Policies**: Properly configured with JOIN through members table
  - Auth chain: `auth.uid()` → `members.user_id` → `league_operators.member_id` → `leagues.operator_id`
  - Operators can SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE their own leagues
  - Public can view active leagues (for player discovery)
- **Historical Tracking**: `league_start_date` (first match) + `created_at` (when created in system)
- **Formatter Functions**: `formatGameType()`, `formatDayOfWeek()` for display

  - `publicRoutes` - No authentication required (10 routes)
  - `authRoutes` - Authentication only (3 routes)
  - `memberRoutes` - Authentication + approved member application (2 routes)
  - `operatorRoutes` - League operator role required (5 routes including /league-rules)
