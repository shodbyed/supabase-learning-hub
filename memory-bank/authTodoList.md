## Technical Considerations

### Data Flow
1. Regular member sees "Become League Operator" invitation
2. User completes league operator application form
3. Payment information collected (UI prepared for future integration)
4. Application submitted for processing
5. Role upgraded to 'league_operator' upon approval
6. Access to league operator dashboard and features

### Database Tables Needed
- `league_operator_profiles` (business details, pool hall info)
- `league_operator_applications` (application status tracking)
- `pool_halls` (venue information and details)
- `leagues` (league management by operators)
- `seasons` (season details: teams, weeks, start/end dates)
- `season_payments` (billing tracking: amount due, payment status, due dates)
- `teams` (team information within leagues)

### UI/UX Patterns
- Follow existing profile edit patterns for form validation
- Maintain consistent design with member profile system
- Use console.log approach for database operations initially
- Progressive disclosure for complex onboarding flow

## Notes

- **Current Status**: Core member management complete, ready for league operator phase
- **Focus**: Transform regular members into league operators with business capabilities
- **Database Strategy**: Continue console.log approach for partner integration
- **Payment Strategy**: Season-based billing ($1/team/week), due by week 3-4 of season
- **Billing Model**: 10 teams Ã— 12 weeks = $120 per season, payable early in season
- **Validation**: Use established Zod validation patterns from profile system
