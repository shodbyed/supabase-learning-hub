# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

### **Just Completed: BCA Tournament Scheduling System**
**Implementation Date**: Latest update to League Creation Wizard
**Status**: ‚úÖ **PRODUCTION READY**

**What Was Built**:
- Complete BCA nationals tournament scheduling step in League Creation Wizard
- Automatic database search functionality triggered by useEffect when step is reached
- Dynamic radio button choices with community-verified dates (including vote counts)
- Clickable "BCA Website" link integration using fetchBCAChampionshipURL()
- Generic info button content that works for both BCA and APA tournaments
- Interface updates to support React elements in subtitle and infoContent

**Technical Implementation**:
- RadioChoiceStep component updated to handle JSX in subtitle
- QuestionStep component supports React.ReactElement in subtitle prop
- SimpleRadioChoice component accepts React.ReactNode in infoContent
- fetchBCAChampionshipURL() generates smart URLs based on current date
- useEffect automatically triggers database search when BCA step is reached
- foundTournamentDates state populates radio button choices dynamically

## Recent Changes

### **Interface Flexibility Enhancement**
**Problem Solved**: Components needed to support rich content like clickable links
**Solution**: Updated all wizard component interfaces to accept React elements
- `subtitle?: string | React.ReactElement` in RadioChoiceStep and QuestionStep
- `infoContent?: React.ReactNode` in SimpleRadioChoice
- Seamless rendering of both plain text and JSX content

### **Tournament URL Management**
**Problem Solved**: Tournament websites change URLs after each year's event
**Solution**: Dynamic URL generation based on current date
- BCA: After March 15, use next year's championship URL
- APA: Static URL structure that doesn't change
- Generic getChampionshipLink() function for reusability

### **Community-Verified Date System**
**Problem Solved**: Different operators may have different tournament date information
**Solution**: Database-driven approach with community verification
- Operators can confirm tournament dates
- Vote counts show reliability of date information
- Multiple date options presented when available
- Fallback to ignore or custom entry options

## Next Steps

### **üéØ IMMEDIATE: APA Tournament Scheduling Implementation**
**Goal**: Apply the proven BCA pattern to APA tournaments
**Required Changes**:
- Replace "BCA" with "APA" in dialog text
- Use fetchAPAChampionshipURL() instead of fetchBCAChampionshipURL()
- Same radio button structure: found dates, ignore, custom entry
- Same automatic database search triggered by useEffect
- Same community voting and date verification system

**Implementation Pattern**:
```typescript
// Same structure as BCA step, just different organization
{
  id: 'apa_nationals_dates',
  title: 'APA National Tournament Scheduling',
  subtitle: (
    <span>
      To avoid conflicts with major tournaments your players may want to attend, please select how to handle APA Nationals dates.
      <br />
      Please verify championship dates at the{' '}
      <a
        href={fetchAPAChampionshipURL()}
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline"
      >
        APA Website
      </a>
      .
    </span>
  ),
  // ... rest same as BCA implementation
}
```

### **Future Enhancements**
- Extend pattern to other tournament organizations (VNEA, UPA, etc.)
- Add tournament conflict detection in league scheduling
- Implement tournament calendar integration
- Create tournament notification system for operators

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### **Reusable Pattern Architecture**
**Decision**: Build tournament scheduling as a reusable pattern
**Rationale**: Multiple tournament organizations need identical functionality
**Implementation**: Generic components with organization-specific configuration

### **Community-Driven Data Approach**
**Decision**: Use operator community to verify tournament dates
**Rationale**: Tournament schedules can change, operator input ensures accuracy
**Implementation**: Vote-based system with fallback options

### **Interface Flexibility Strategy**
**Decision**: Support both string and React element content in component interfaces
**Rationale**: Enables rich content like links without component proliferation
**Implementation**: Union types (string | React.ReactElement) with seamless rendering

## Current Status Summary

‚úÖ **BCA Tournament Scheduling**: Complete production implementation
üéØ **APA Tournament Scheduling**: Ready for immediate implementation using established pattern
üîÑ **Component Architecture**: Flexible interfaces supporting rich content
üìä **Database Integration**: Mock operations with clear console logging for partner team
üèóÔ∏è **Reusable Patterns**: Tournament scheduling pattern ready for extension to other organizations
