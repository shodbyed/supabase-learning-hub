## Active Decisions and Considerations

### **Educational Content Strategy**
**Decision**: Provide exhaustive detail upfront with credibility statement
**Rationale**: Operators need complete understanding before committing; 15 years experience provides authority
**Implementation**: Comprehensive detail pages with acknowledgment that it's "a lot to read"

### **Format Comparison Approach**
**Decision**: Separate comparison page rather than inline
**Rationale**: Allows focused comparison without cluttering individual format pages
**Implementation**: Dedicated comparison page with quick summary cards for each format

### **Public Access Philosophy**
**Decision**: Make all format detail pages public (no login required)
**Rationale**: Operators should be able to review system before committing to registration
**Implementation**: Public routes in NavRoutes.tsx

### **Handicap System Transparency**
**Decision**: Explain every detail of handicap calculation with concrete examples
**Rationale**: Transparency reduces complaints and builds operator confidence
**Implementation**: Step-by-step examples, charts, real-world scenarios, rounding demonstrations

### **Team Modifier Complexity**
**Decision**: Show 4 different standing scenarios to explain modifier calculation
**Rationale**: Complex concept needs multiple examples to be understood
**Implementation**: Example standings table with 4 matchup calculations + "additional teams below" indicator
