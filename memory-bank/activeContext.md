# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

- Modularizing navigation into `NavBar` and `NavRoutes` components.
- Adding and linking the `Home` and `About` pages to the navigation.
- Refining CSS for navigation and layout to ensure proper alignment and responsiveness.

## Recent Changes

- Created a `Home` page with a link to the Login page.
- Created an `About` page and added it to the navigation.
- Updated routing to include `/`, `/about`, and `/login`.
- Modularized CSS for navigation into `navigation.css`.
- Ensured the navigation bar spans the full width of the screen with a dark blue border.

## Next Steps

- Enhance the `Home` and `About` page with additional content or styling.
- Add authentication logic to protect certain routes (e.g., `/dashboard`).
- Create a secure page (e.g., dashboard) for logged-in users.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Ensure the navigation flow is simple and intuitive.
- Protect secure routes to prevent unauthorized access.
