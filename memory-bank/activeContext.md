# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

- Ensuring the `UserContext` integrates seamlessly with navigation and page components.
- Using `UserContext` to dynamically control navigation links and page access based on the user's authentication state.

## Recent Changes

- Created a `Home` page with a link to the Login page.
- Created an `About` page and added it to the navigation.
- Updated routing to include `/`, `/about`, and `/login`.
- Modularized CSS for navigation into `navigation.css`.
- Ensured the navigation bar spans the full width of the screen with a dark blue border.
- Added `UserContext` to manage user authentication state.
- Created `UserProvider` to wrap the app and provide `UserContext` to all components.
- Implemented `useUser` hook to simplify access to the `UserContext`.
- Separated `UserContext`, `UserProvider`, and `useUser` into individual files to improve maintainability and compatibility with React Fast Refresh.

## Next Steps

- Enhance the `Home` and `About` page with additional content or styling.
- Add authentication logic to protect certain routes (e.g., `/dashboard`).
- Create a secure page (e.g., dashboard) for logged-in users.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Ensure the navigation flow is simple and intuitive.
- Protect secure routes to prevent unauthorized access.
