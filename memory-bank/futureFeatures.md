# Future Features & Enhancement Ideas

This document captures aspirational features that would enhance the app's desirability and user engagement. These are not core functionality but ideas that could differentiate the platform and make it more compelling.

## Social & Community Features

### In-App Messaging System (Required for Contact Privacy)
**Status**: Needed for MVP - supports "in_app_only" contact visibility

**Core Requirements**:
- Basic one-to-one messaging between users
- Group messaging (operator to all teams, captain to team members, etc.)
- Message threading/conversations
- Notification system (in-app and email notification of new messages)
- Simple, no-frills design

**Use Cases**:
- Operator with "in_app_only" email/phone ‚Üí players can message them through app
- Captain can message entire team
- Operator can broadcast message to all teams in a league
- Players can contact each other without sharing personal contact info

**Technical Needs**:
- `messages` table (id, sender_id, recipient_id, content, thread_id, timestamps)
- `message_threads` table (id, participants[], last_message_at)
- `group_messages` table (id, sender_id, group_type, group_id, content)
- Message read/unread status tracking
- Push notification integration

**Note**: This is **essential infrastructure**, not a "nice to have". Without it, operators who choose "in_app_only" visibility cannot be contacted.

## League Operator Management Features

### Assistant Operators System
**Status**: Future consideration - not yet designed

**Concept**: Allow main operators to delegate certain administrative tasks to trusted assistants

**Key Requirements** (to be determined):
- Main operator can assign assistant operators to help manage their leagues
- Assistant permissions system (what they CAN do vs what they CAN'T do)
- Main operator retains full control and payment responsibility
- Clear permission boundaries and audit trail

**Open Questions**:
- Can an assistant work for multiple main operators?
- What specific permissions should assistants have?
  - Enter match scores?
  - Approve team registrations?
  - Edit schedules?
  - View financial reports?
  - Communicate with players?
- What should assistants NOT be able to do?
  - Create new leagues?
  - Handle payments?
  - Delete leagues/seasons?
  - Remove teams?
- Does main operator grant individual permissions, or do all assistants have same fixed permissions?
- How is assistant access revoked?

**Note**: This feature should be designed after core league management is working. May require role-based access control (RBAC) system and permission framework.

## Integration Opportunities

## Notes for Consideration

- **User Research Needed**: Many features would benefit from user feedback and usage data
- **Monetization Potential**: Some features could support premium tiers or sponsorship
- **Technical Complexity**: Features range from simple additions to major architectural changes
- **Market Differentiation**: Focus on features that competitors don't offer well
