The page number is where you will find the Applied Ruling. Currently, some \npages are off by 1 page. This is in the process of being repaired.\nThe editor would like to express his thanks to Ozzy Reynolds for his support, and to \nthe players, league operators and referees whose comments and contributions throughout \nthe years  are reflected in the ongoing evolution of the CSI Rules. \nWe encourage all of you to continue to offer comments and suggestions.  The best way to \nhave your voice heard is to send a detailed e-mail to John Leyman at \njohn.leyman @playcsipool.com.  Please use \u201cRules Comments\u201d as your subject line.  \nBecause of the volume of correspondence, please do not offer your comments by phone, \ntext, FB messenger or other means . \nEditor \nJohn Leyman, CSI Rules Administrator and Director of Referees \nCSI Statement of Principles  \nThese are principles that CSI believes in, promotes, and uses to develop The Official \nRules of CueSports International.  They are published here to help players, officials and \nadministrators understand what CSI believes comprises the spirit of the game. They are \ngeneral statements and are not part of the rules themselves.  However, if a situation \noccurs for which there is not specific guidance in the CSI rules, Administrative \nAuthorities may look to these principles to assist them in making an appropriate decision. \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL \n4 \uf0d8To maintain a gender-neutral presentation, the singular possessive pronoun forms \n\"their\", \u201cthey\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d are used throughout the rules. \n\uf0d8Every player, referee, event official, tournament director and league operator should \nhave the freedom of open and equal access to the CSI Rules, Applied Rulings and \nevent regulations.\n\uf0d8Despite the \u201cplayer responsibility\u201d clause of Rule 1-1, it is more important that the \ngame be decided by the players' pool-playing ability than by their knowledge of the \nrules.  Therefore, upon request and within the guidelines of the rules, referees will \nassist players whenever asked, including helping players understand the rules and \ntheir application.  However, players' ignorance of the rules is never a defense against \nany penalties that they may incur under them.\n\uf0d8 The CSI rules are for every player, regardless of talent, skill, experience or \nknowledge.  Whether you are a first-time player or a seasoned professional, if you \nlearn the CSI rules and follow them faithfully, they will help guide you to an \nenjoyable and fair experience.  Similarly, no player may use their stature, level of \nexperience, or knowledge to claim, impose, or gain an unfair advantage by \nimproperly manipulating, circumventing or evading the CSI rules or event \nregulations.\n\uf0d8 We believe that the rules can never be too detailed, and that they should cover as \nmany situations as possible.  CSI will make every attempt to provide as much \ninformation as possible to help ensure the uniform and consistent enforcement of the \nrules.\n\uf0d8 CSI referees are enforcers of rules - not legislators.  No CSI referee makes any final \npolicy decisions regarding the content or effect of the CSI Rules.  All official \ninterpretations and Applied Rulings are made by the CSI National Office and are \nsolely their responsibility.  In unusual situations, referees, whenever possible, must \nfirst look to the Administrative Authority for guidance before making a ruling.   (See \nCSI Rules 1 0-5-3 and 10-5-4.)\n\uf0d8 There are some significant differences between The Official Rules of CueSports \nInternational and other sets of billiards rules.  Those differences are not accidental  \nor unintended.  It is improper to use any other set of rules as a reference or as  \nguidance in reaching a resolution to any situation in CSI play.\n\uf0d8 Players should not be penalized under the rules for situations or events over which \nthey have absolutely no control.\n\uf0d8 Luck is an inherent part of all sports, games and competition.  It is neither possible \nnor desirable to use the rules to legislate all luck out of the game .\nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL \n5 A Note about Sportsmanship and Communication \nGood sportsmanship lies at the heart of any endeavor involving competition.  In many \ngames of pocket billiards, players meet on the table in a contest that takes place in an \nenvironment that is unique in sports in one significant aspect - players are often required \nto tell each other exactly what is about to happen and what their intentions are before  they \nact. \nAny experienced referee or tournament director will tell you that many of the problems \nthey have faced involving controversy between players could have been prevented if the \nplayers had been communicating effectively.  Far too many disputes involve nothing \nmore than whether or not a safety was declared or which pocket or ball was called. \nThe difficulty can often be traced to players who simply do not practice good and polite \ncommunication at the table.  We designed the CSI rules to reduce the number of disputes. \nHowever, it is impossible to control the issue completely with rules and referees.  The \nsolution lies with you \u2013 the players. \nWe encourage you to dedicate yourself to open, friendly and polite communication \nduring your match: \n\uf0d8 When you are at the table, pay attention to how your shot appears.  If you think\nthere is a chance that your opponent might not understand your intentions,\nplease call the shot.\n\uf0d8 When you do call shots, please do so clearly.  It is preferable to face your\nopponent and make eye contact.  If you do call a shot by gesture, make a clear\nand definite motion indicating both ball and pocket.\n\uf0d8 When you are in the chair, you should pay attention to the game and to your\nopponent.  Communication is a two way street!  If your opponent is telling you\nwhat they intend to do, listen carefully and clearly acknowledge that you\nunderstand.  If you do not understand, get clarification.\n\uf0d8 Do not let personality conflicts affect your efforts at communication.  It does\nnot matter how you feel about your opponent \u2013 you must always commit\nyourself to open and civil conversation and communication during your match.\nRemember that your opponent has the right to know what you are doing while you are at \nthe table.  If you do not want to stop and answer questions, you can prevent that by \ncommunicating freely and clearly.  As the person in the chair, you must remember that \nwhile you have the right to know what the shooter is attempting, you cannot interrupt \nthem after they are down on a shot.  If you sense a situation developing in which you \nmight have a question, try to ask it early.  At the same time, remember that you cannot \nuse the requirement of communication in an unsportsmanlike manner.  You should know \nwhat a clearly obvious shot is.  Do not ask unnecessary questions in such a situation.   See \nApplied Ruling 1- 16 for guidance. \nWhen playing call shot games, remember that shots defined as not obvious, and safeties, \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL \n6 must  be explicitly called.  There are no exceptions under any circumstances , regardless \nof ho w simple or obvious the shot may appear.  There may be other types of shots that \nmust be called as well, depending on the circumstances.  Also, please be sure to \ncommunicate clearly with your opponent when playing a safety.   The Rules and Applied \nRulings have additional guidance for calling shots and safeties. \nGood communication is simply good sportsmanship, which is required of all players. \nPlease practice it faithfully and consistently.  It will make the game more enjoyable for \nall of us."

    "content": "EQUIPMENT SPECIFICATIONS \nTable specifications (paragraphs 1-7) apply to CSI National Tournaments.  Although they \nare not mandatory for other tournaments or league play, it is suggested that they be \nadhered to whenever possible.   Paragraphs 8-10  apply to all CSI play. \n1. Table Size and Playing Surface (Figure ES-1) . CSI recognizes three sizes of tables and\nplaying surfaces as regulation (all \u00b11/16\u201d):\nTable Size Playing Surface \n 3 \u00bd\u2019 x 7\u2019        40\u201d x 80\u201d  \n 4\u2019 x 8\u2019       45\u201d x 90\u201d  \n 4 \u00bd\u2019 x 9       50\u201d x 100\u201d  \n2. Table Bed Height:  the height of the top of the playing surface measured from the floor\nwill be 30\u201d, \u00b1\u00bd\u201d.\nThe playing surface is measured by \nstraight lines from cushion no se to \ncushion nose of the opposite side , \nand perpendicular to the cushions.  \nFigure ES -1 \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL \n7 Figure ES -2 3. Cushions.  The height of the cushion nose measured from the playing surface will be\n129/64\u201d, +1/64\u201d or \u20131/32\u201d.\n4. Diamonds.  The center of all diamonds will be 311/16\u201d from the cushion nose (no\ntolerance).\n5. Pocket Openings.  Corner pockets: 4\u00bd\u201d , \u00b11/16\u201d.  Side pockets: 5\u201d, \u00b11/16\u201d.  CSI\nmeasures pocket openings by the \u201cgate method\u201d rather than the traditional method of\nmeasuring between the tips of the cushions.  If a ball entering the mouth of a pocket\ncontacts the cushion within the mouth, it does so at a point well below the cushion nose.\nThe gate method provides a more accurate measurement of a pocket opening based on the\ntrue action of a ball entering the mouth of the pocket.\nAn easy and proper way to measure a pocket using the gate method is shown in Figure \nES-2.  Using two new striped balls, place the balls in the mouth of the pocket with the \nstripes facing up and lined up.  Set them so that each ball touches the vertical cut of the \ncushion and so that a line extending across the mouth of the pocket from cushion tip to \ncushion tip bisects the stripes lengthwise.  Note that the balls do not touch the tips of the \ncushion, but instead contact the cushion at a point below the tip. \nWhen properly placed in corner pockets the balls will: \n\uf0d8be just touching each other \u2013 a pocket opening of exactly 4\u00bd\u201d, or;\n\uf0d8have a gap of up to 1/16\u201d between them (tolerance to 49/16\u201d), or;\n\uf0d8require slight compression into the cushions to place as described (tolerance to\n47/16\u201d).\nIf the gap between the balls is more than 1/16\u201d or the pocket opening is too narrow to place \nthem easily as described, the pocket opening does not meet CSI specifications. \nWhen properly placed in the side pockets t he balls should have a gap of \u00bd\u201d between \nthem.  If the gap is less than 7/16\u201d or more than 9/16\u201d, the pocket opening does not meet CSI \nspecifications. \n6. Pocket Cushion Angles (Figure ES-3) .  The horizontal interior angles of the cushions\nat the pockets will be 141\u00b0 \u00b1 1\u00b0 at a corner pocket and 100\u00b0 \u00b1 1\u00b0 at a side pocket.  The\nvertical cushion angle within the mouth of all pockets will be between 12\u00b0 and 15\u00b0.\nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL  \n 8 Corner pocket - 141\u00b0 \nSide pocket - 100\u00b0  \nFigure ES -3 12\u00b0-15\u00b0 \nBed Cushion \nnose \nwithin the \npocket  \nmouth  \nBall placed so it is \ntouching the cushion and \nas close to drop point as \npossible without falling in.  Shelf depth is correct \nwhen 40% of the ball \n(shaded area \u2013 \napproximately 7/8\") is \noutside of a line \nextending from and \nalong the cushion nose.  \nFigure ES -4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7.  Pocket Shelf Depth (Figure ES -4). CSI measures shelf depth in relation to the \ndimensions of a ball. Figure ES -4 shows how shelf depth is determined.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8.  Balls .  All balls will have a diameter of 2\u00bc\u201d \u00b1 .005\u201d.  The weight of the balls will be \nbetween 5\u00bd and 6 ounces, but all object balls used in any match must  be of equal weight.  \nSlight variations in the weight of the cue ball with respect to the object balls may occur \ndepending on the type of the cue ball . \n \n9.  Cues \n \na. The width of the cue tip must not exceed 14 millimeters.  There is no \nminimum width.  \nb. The weight of the cue must not exceed 25 ounces.  There is no minimum \nweight.  \nc. The length of the cue must be at least 40 inches.  There is no maximum \nlength.  \nd. The cue tip  must be composed of leather, fibrous, or pliable material .  \n \n \n \n \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL  \n 9 10.  Mechanical Bridges  \nThe primary consideration for determining whether a mechanical  bridge is legal is \nthat it supports the cue , as opposed to elevating the bridge hand above the bed of the \ntable or significantly enhancing the stability of the hand holding the bridge.  \nThe particular construction of the bridge is not relevant as long as i t does no more \nthan support the cue, and does not damage the table or other equipment.  Items that \nare not considered disqualifying include, but are not limited to:  \n\uf0d8 The overall size, or the height of grooves above the bed of the table;  \n\uf0d8 whether there is a  handle, sliding extensions, wheels , or accommodations to \nstraddle balls ; \n\uf0d8 the shape of grooves;  \n\uf0d8 whether the grooves have linings or mechanisms to retain the cue in the groove.  \n \nIf the above information is not sufficient to determine to whether a particular b ridge \ndesign is considered legal , please contact the CSI National office, and include a \npicture of the bridge in use on a table with your communication.

    "content": "GENERAL RULES  \n \n \nThese rules apply to all CSI tournaments, league play, and other CSI events.  Unless \nclearly contradicted or suspended by specific game rules, the General R ules apply to all \ngames.  \n \n1-1 Player Responsibility  \n \n1.  You are responsible for knowing the rules, applied rulings, regulations, and schedules \nthat pertain to any CSI event you enter.  You are also responsible for cooperating w ith all \nreferees and event officials, and for accurately providing all requested information \nconcerning your participation in the event to referees and event officials when asked to \ndo so.  \n \n2.  Event officials  and referees will provi de information as required by the rules to the \nbest of their ability and knowledge.  However, Rule 1 -1 takes precedence and the \nultimate responsibility for knowing the correct information still rests with you.  You may  \nstill incur penalties if you commit a foul or violate the rules as a result of incorrect \ninformation provided to you by an event official or referee.  (AR p. 9 9) \n \n1-2 Acceptance of Provided Equipment   \n \n1.  Once your match begins, you accept all provided equipment as standard and legal.  \nAfter a match has begun, only a referee or event official may declare the equipment \ndefective or unsuitable for play.  If the equipment is d eclared unsuitable for play, all \ngames previously played on that equipment will be counted.  (AR p. 7 8) \n \n2.  During a match, it is a foul if you attempt to modify provided equipment without the \npermission of a referee o r event official.  The foul occurs immediately upon the attempt, \nregardless of whether a stroke or shot is attempted. (AR p. 7 8) \n \n1-3 Use of Equipment   \n \nCSI reserves the right to prohibit  any equipment it deems untested or inappropriate, or \nthat has not been evaluated by the CSI National Office.  \n \n1.  You are responsible for all equipment  and accessory items you bring to the table (AR \np. 79).  You may not use equipment or accessory items in a manner other than their \nintended use.  Specifically:  \n \na. You may use a billiards glove . \nb. You may use either a built -in or an add -on cue  extender . \nc. You may us e your own chalk  provided that it closely matches the color of \nthe cloth. (AR p. 7 9). \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL  \n 24  Penalty for (c): first offense \u2013 warning.  Second and subsequent offenses \u2013\n foul. \nd. You may not shoot while using more than two mechanical bridge s at any \none time.  A bridge may only be used to support the cue or another bridge .  \nIf two bridges are used, the upper bridge must rest on the head of the \nlower bridge. (AR p. 73). \ne. You may not shoot while using any item to support or elevate  your bridge \nhand .  You may hold chalk in your bridge hand while bridging, but the \nchalk may not be used to elevate your hand off the table.  \n Penalty for (d -e): foul upon execution of the shot.  If no shot is  \n executed then there is no foul. \nf. You may use your cue,  held in your hand or not, to help align a shot.  You \nmay use your cue and hands to measure angles and distances for bank  \nshots and kick shots.   No other cues, bridges or equipment may be used. \n(AR p. 79). \ng. You may only use your vision to judge whether  the cue ball or an object \nball would fit through a gap , or to judge what ball the cue ball would \ncontact first .  You may not use any ball, cue, rack , chalk cube, or any other \nequipment or other  part of your body as a width -measuring  device . (AR p. \n79). \n \n Penalty for (f -g): Foul immediately upon the violation, regardless of  \n whether a shot is executed.  \n \n2.  You may not wear any electronic  headgea r, use any electronic  device, or voluntarily \nimpede your hearing  during a match.  Examples include, but are not limited to:  \n \na. Use of h eadphones , earphones, or earplugs  of any kin d, including \nBluetooth accessories, whether turned on or not.  Hearing aids are \npermitted.  \nb. Use of c ell phones , smart phones, pagers, or music devices.  Cell phones \nmay be worn on the belt or kept in pockets, but may not be accessed for \nmessages , information or conversations at any time during a match by \nsingles or scotch doubles players, or during your game in team play.  You \nmust turn off all audible ringers and other notification tones while on the \nevent floor.   \n \nThe penalty for the f irst violation of Rule 1 -3-2 during an event is a warning.  Each  \nsubsequent violation is a foul.  \n \n1-4 Cue Requirements  \n \n1.  Your cues must meet CSI specifications.  \n \n2.  It is a foul if you shoot  with a cue that does not meet CSI specifications.  The cue must \nbe removed from play.  (AR p. 80) \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL  \n 25  \n1-5 Start Time of Match  \n \nThe start time for your match is the scheduled time or the time the match is  announced, \nwhichever is later.  If you are not present at the table with your equipment  within the time \nallowed by Tournament Administrators , you lose the match by forfeit. (AR p.  81) \n \n1-6 Playing Without a Referee  \n \nWhen a referee is not available, the Tournament Director  or designated event official  will \nfulfill the duties of the referee.  \n \n1-7 Beginning and End  of Game or Match  \n \n1. Your match or ga me begins  when the cue tip strikes the cue ball during any stroke on \nthe break shot . (AR p. 81) \n \n2.  Your match or game  ends when the game -winning ball is legally pocketed and all \nballs on th e table have stopped moving . After that time, there can be no fouls involving \nthe game on the table for that game. However, unsportsmanlike conduct immediately \nafter a game or match may be penalized by loss of that game or match, or by other \npenalty at the  referee\u2019s discretion.    \n \n1-8 No Practice  Allowed During Match  (Tournament Play Only)  \n \n1.  It is a foul if you practice at any time during your match, including during time-outs \nand periods of suspended play .  \"Pr actice\" is defined as any stroke or shot that is not a \npart of your match, taken on any table at the event venue .  (AR p . 81) \n \n2.  During a match, if the first offense of a practice foul occurs between games there is no \npenalty applied,  but a warning will be issued.  For second and subsequent offenses \nbetween games during a match, the offended player:  \n \na. Is awarded the option to break if it is not their turn to break.  If the \noffended player chooses to take the break, the breaking order fo r future \ngames is not affected.  \nb. Is awarded ball in hand on the first shot after the break if it is their turn to \nbreak.  The penalty is not applied if there is a foul on the break.  \n \n3.  In team play, this rule applies to all members of the team that are in the teams line -up, \nwhether or not they are playing at the time and whether or not they are listed on the score \nsheet of the match in progress.  Penalties for fouls in team play:  \n \na. For violations by a player who is  playing a game at t he time of the foul : \nthe penalty is applied to that player\u2019s table only;  \nb. For violations by a player who is not playing a game at th e time of the \nfoul: the penalty is applied to all tables  assigned to the match .  (AR p. 82) \n \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL  \n 26 1-9 Stopping Play  \n \n1.  You may stop play to request the assistance of a referee  if you believe that a foul may \noccur or has occurred, or if you need information concerning the rules.  If you desire to \nstop play, you must notify your oppone nt and your opponent must acknowledge your \nrequest.  If it is your opponent\u2019s inning, you must notify them before they are down on \nthe shot.  It is a foul if you interrupt your opponent after they are down on a shot.  (AR p. \n82) \n \n2.  If your opponent reques ts that play be stopped in order to summon a referee  or other \nevent official, you must acknowledge and honor that request.  After play has stopped, it is \na foul if you take any stroke or shot until a referee authorizes you to shoo t. \n \n1-10 Suspended Play  \n \nPlay may be suspended at the referee's discretion.  It is a foul if you take any stroke or \nshot while play is suspended.  (AR p. 82) \n \n1-11 Time -Out \n \nIf time -outs are allowed by event regulations,  you may only take a time -out during your \ninning , or when it is your turn to break.  Each player is allowed one time -out per match.  \nTime -outs are limited to five minutes.  If you exceed your allotted five minutes, or leave \nthe playing area when not author ized to do so, you will forfeit  one game for every two -\nminute period you fail to return to the match.  The two -minute period begins once a \nreferee has determined you are not present when you should be.  Time -outs are not \nallowed in team pla y during CSI sanctioned tournaments.  (AR p. 80, 81) \n \n1-12 Lag for Break  \n \nThis rule applies if players are required to lag by event regulations.  \n \n1.  The lag begins with each player having ball in hand behind the head string, one to t he \nleft of the long string and one to the right.  The balls must be of equal size and weight.  \nThe players shoot at approximately the same time toward the foot cushion.  The ball must \ncontact the foot cushion.  When the balls come to rest, the player whose  ball is closest to \nthe head cushion wins the lag.  The players will lag again if the lag is a tie, or if one \nplayer strikes the ball after the other player's ball has contacted the foot cushion.  \n \n2.  You lose the lag  if your ball:  \n \na. does not contact the foot cushion;  \nb. contacts the foot cushion more than once;  \nc. crosses the long string;  \nd. contacts a side cushion;  \ne. is pocketed or jumped off the table;  \nf. comes to rest past the nose of the head cushion (see Di agram 3 ). \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL  \n 27 Final position of lag  \nHead Cushion  Edge of ball comes to \nrest past the nose of \nthe head cushion.  \nDiagram 3 \u2013 Illegal Lag Result   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3.  The player who wins the lag may either break or require their opponent to break.  \n \n1-13 Break ing Subsequent Games of a Match  \n \nIn matches consisting of multiple games, the Administrative Authority of the e vent will \nset the procedure for determining which player or team will break subsequent racks.  (AR \np. 84) \n \n1-14 Racking Procedures   \n \n1.  You must rack for yourself when you are breaking.  (Exception: 14.1 Continuous)  \n \n2.  You must  rack the balls as tight ly as possible.  E ach ball should touch all balls \nadjacent to it. (AR p.  78) \n \n3.  After you rack the balls, your opponent may inspect the rack but must not touch any \nball.  If your opponent is not satisfied with the rack, they may r equire you to re -rack the \nballs one time.  After one re -rack, if both players cannot agree that the rack is suitable for \nplay a referee must be called.  The referee will then rack the balls for that game.  If the \nreferee racks the balls, the opponent may in spect the rack but must accept the rack as is.  \n \n4.  You should refrain from tapping balls  unless necessary.  It is preferable to brush the \narea of the rack and ensure that the spot attached to the cloth, if any, is in good condition.  \n \n5.  If the arrangement of the rack  does not meet the requirements of the specific game, it \nwill be corrected without penalty.  If your opponent's rack does not meet the requirements  \nand yo u do not notify them before they break, the game will continue with no penalty.  \n \n1-15 Shot Clock  Procedures  \n \n1.  There is normally no time limit  for you to take a shot.  However, a referee may \nimplement a sh ot clock if they judge that you are delaying a match unnecessarily or in an \nunsportsmanlike manner, or if event officials  require that a match proceed at a faster \npace. (AR p. 84, 107) \n \n2.  You may call a referee if you believe your opponent is deliberately or consistently \nplaying at an abnormally slow  pace.  If, after a reasonable period of observation, the \nreferee judges that slow play is occurring, they will warn the offending player(s).  After \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL  \n 28 the warning, if the  referee judges  that the pace of play remains abnormally slow, they will \nplace the player(s)  on a 45 -second shot clock.  \n \n3.  Shot clock procedures are: \n \na. The shot clock does not apply to the first shot after the break in any game.  \nb. During a player\u2019s inning, the shot clock starts when the previous shot ends \nand runs for 45 seconds or until cue tip to cue ball contact begins the next \nshot.  If a player has ball in hand , the shot clock starts when the player has \npossession of  the cue ball and any spotting  of balls or racking is finished.  \nc. If they are not already down on the shot  when ten seconds remain on the \nshot clock, the player will receive  a ten second warning from the referee \n(announced as clearly as \u201cten\u201d , loudly enough for the shooter to hear ).  If \nthe player does not strike the cue ball within ten seconds, it is a foul. (AR \np. 85) \nd. If a player is already down on the shot with ten seconds  remaining , no \nannouncement is made.  The shot clock  will pause at ten seconds and the \nplayer may exceed the 45 -second limit provided they do not stand up off \nthe shot.  However, if the player stands up off the shot, the referee wi ll \nimmediately announce \u201cten\u201d, and the shot clock will resume. If the player \ndoes not strike the cue ball within ten secon ds, it is foul . (AR p. 85) \ne. For timing purposes, \u201cdown on the shot\u201d means the player is in a \ncustomary shooting position as it relates to their bridge hand and grip of \nthe cue, or, if using a mechanical bridge , the bridge has been placed for \nthe shot and the cue placed in the bridge\u2019s groove with the player\u2019s grip \nhand on the cue.  \nf. Each player is permitted one 45 -second extension  per rack.  If both players \nare on the hill, each player is permitted two 45 -second extensions.  To use \nan extension, the player must verbally announce \u201cextension\u201d to the \nreferee.  The referee will then respond with \u201cextension\u201d or, if the player \nhas no extension remaining, \u201cextension not allowed\u201d.  For extensions , \nprocedures with ten seconds remaining  are the same as for other shots.  \ng. The shot clock will pause  if play is stopped to summon  a referee, and will \nstart again when the referee authorizes the player to shoot.  In a game in \nwhich a referee is presiding, the shot clock will pause if play must be \ndelayed to allow the referee to take up a position, examine the table, or for \nany other administrative stoppage.  In either case (referee presiding or \nnot), after an administrative stoppage the shot clock may, at the referee\u2019s \ndiscretion, be reset before  author izing the player to shoot.    \n \n1-16 Calling Ball and Pocket  (AR p. 74, 82, 85) \n \nRule 1 -16 applies only to games designated by specific game rules as Call Shot game s. \n \n1.  You must designate the called ball  and the called pocket  before each sho t.  You may \nmake the designation verbally or by a clear, unambiguous gesture.    You are not required \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL  \n 29 to call obvious shot s.  You are not required to indicate incidental kisses and caroms, or \nincidental cushion contacts that do not con stitute bank shots or kick shots.   Not all kisses, \ncaroms and cushion contacts are incidental.  If a dispute arises as to whether a shot was \nobvious based on such contact, the referee is the sole judge. (AR p. 74, 82) \n \n2. You may only call one ball on a sh ot.   If you call more than one ball, or if you use any \nconditional phrase such as \u201cjust in case\u201d concerning  possibly pocketing  more than one \nball, your inning ends after the shot regardless of whether you pock et any ball.  Any ball \npocketed on such a shot is an illegally pocketed ball.  Your opponent accepts the table in \nposition.  (10 -Ball exception: Rule 4 -8, Opponent\u2019s Option , applies.)  \n \n3.  If you are not certain what shot  your opponent is attempting, it is your responsibility \nto ask.  You must ask  before your opponent is down on the shot.  With the exception of \nshots defined as not obvious , if you do n ot ask and a dispute arises as to whether the shot \nwas obvious, the referee is the sole judge.  \n  \n4.  You must always call shots that are defined as not obvious .  This rule applies \nregardless  of whether or not your opponent  asks about the shot, and regardless of how \nsimple or obvious the shot may appear.  \n \n5.  When calling shots defined as not obvious , you are only required to designa te the \ncalled ball and called pocket.  If shooting a combination shot, you do not have to say the \nword \u201ccombination\u201d, or state which ball will be struck first or the sequence of balls.  \nWhen shooting a bank shot or kick shot you do not have to say the word  \u201cbank\u201d or \u201ckick\u201d \nnor specify which cushions will be involved in the shot.  \n \n6.  When the game winning ball  is your legal object ball, if you pocket the ball on a shot \ndefined as not obvious but fail to call the shot: your inning e nds, the ball is spotted, and \nthe incoming player must accept the  table in position.  Exception: Rule 1 -16-6 does not \napply to 8 -Ball.   (See Rule 2 -10-e.) \n \n7.  If you do not call a shot defined as not obvious  and you pocket any ball on such a \nshot, your inning ends .  The incoming player accept s the table in position.  \n \n8.  A shot that was obvious prior to the s hot will count for the shooter if the shot \ninadvertently:  \n \na. becomes a bank shot because the called ball did not go directly into the \ncalled pocket but instead contacted two or more cushions prior to being \npocketed in the called pocket, or;  \nb. becomes a kick sh ot because the cue ball initially missed the called ball, \ncontacted one or more cushions, and then pocketed the called ball in the \ncalled pocket.  \n \n1-17 Calling a Safety  \n \nThis rule applies to 8 -Ball and 14.1 Continuous.  \n \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL  \n 30 Without applying a substantial \nforward stroke motion, the \nplayer lifts the cue vertically or \nmoves it sideways or at an \nangle, p ropelling the cue ball \nwith a brushing motion.  \nDiagram 4 \u2013 Illegal Stroke  \n5 C1 C2 \nC3 5-ball frozen to cushion, cue ball at C1.  \nCue ball contacts 5 -ball at C2, then contacts \ncushion at C3.  5-ball comes to rest as shown.  \nNo other balls are involved in  the shot, neither cue \nball nor 5 -ball contacts any other cushion or ball.  \nDiagram 5 \u2013 Legal Cushion Contact  1.  If playing a safety, you must communicate with your opponent in a clear and \nunambiguous manner.  Safeties must be called verbally \u2013 gestures are not sufficient,  no \nmatter h ow clear they may appear.   \n   \n2. The non -shooting player has responsibilities  when a safety is called, and should \nacknowledge a called safety in a clear and unambiguous manner. If a dispute arise s as to \nwhether a safety was called, the referee is the sole judge.   \n \n1-18 Legal Stroke  \n \nYou must use a legal stroke.  Any lifting, sideways, or other brushing motion of the cue , \nsuch that the for ce that propels the cue ball does not primarily result from a forward \nmotion of the cue as defined under \u201cLegal Stro ke\u201d, is a foul (see Diagram 4 ). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1-19 Legal Shot  (AR p. 87) \n \n1.  For a shot to be legal, the first ball contacted by the cue ball must be a legal object \nball, or a simultaneous hit with a legal and illegal object ball may occur.  After  that \ncontact:  \n \na. any object ball must be pocketed, or;  \nb. any object ball  or the cue ball must contact a cushion . \n \nIt is a foul if one of those requirements is not met.  \n  \n2.  If the ball used to meet the cushion contact requirement  of Rule 1 -19-1-b is declared \nfrozen to a cushion at the beginning of the shot, then that ball must leave the cushion it is \nfrozen  to and then:  \n \na. contact a cushion other than the one to which it was frozen, or;  \nb. contact another  object  ball before it con tacts the cushion to which it was \nfrozen.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL  \n 31 3. The shot detailed  in Diagram 5 meets  the requirements of paragraph 1 -19-2 and is \nlegal.  \n \n4.  An object ball is not considered frozen to a cushion unless it is declared  frozen \nimmediately prior to the shot  and before the shooter is down on the shot.  \n \n5. Contacting a ball frozen to a cushion does not constitute contacting that cushion.  \n \n1-20 Cue Ball Frozen  to Object Ball or Cushion (AR p. 89) \n \n1.  The cue ball is not considered frozen to an object ball or cushion unless it is declared \nfrozen  immediately prior to the shot.    \n \n2.  If  the cue ball is frozen to a legal object ball, it is legal to shoot toward the object ball \nprovided you use a legal stroke . \n \n3.  If the cue ball is frozen to a cushion, it is legal to shoot the cue ball into the cushion \nprovided you u se a legal stroke.  \n \n4.  Despite the legality of the stroke with respect to the cue ball and frozen ball or \ncushion, the presence of one or more other object balls or a cushion nearby a frozen cue \nball or object ball may create the possibility of a violatio n of Rule 1 -30 involving the cue \nball and the nearby ball or cushion.  \n \n5.  Shooting the cue ball away from an object ball that is frozen  to the cue ball does not \nconstitute contacting that object ball.  \n \n1-21 Penalties for Foul s \n \n1.  If you commit a foul, or otherwise violate the rules, you are penalized according to the \nGeneral Rules and the specific rules of the game being played.  \n \n2.  Unless otherwise state d in the General Rules or specific game rules, if you commit a \nfoul or otherwise violate the rules: your inning ends and your opponent receives ball in \nhand . \n \n3. Some fouls specify a warning for the first offense during a match.  Howev er, if you \ncontinually commit such fouls from match to match, it may be considered \nUnsportsmanlike Conduct  and the penalties for the first offense of those fouls may be \nmore severe.  \n \n1-22 Successive Fouls  \n \nThis rule applies to 9-Ball, 10 -Ball, 14.1 Continuous and One Pocket.  \n \n1.  You always begin a game with a successive foul count of zero.  When you commit a \nfoul, your successive foul count is one (referred to as \u201con one foul\u201d ) and you incur the \nnormal penalty for the foul.  \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL  \n 32 2.  When you are on one foul, if your next shot is legal, your successive foul count resets \nto zero.  If you fail to make a legal shot, your successive foul count is two (referred to as \n\u201con two fouls\u201d .)  You  also incur the normal penalty for the second foul.  \n \n3.  When you are on two fouls, if your next shot is legal, your successive foul count resets \nto zero.  If you fail to make a legal shot, your successive foul count is three and you incur \nthe penalty ind icated by specific game rules.  After the penalty, your successive foul \ncount resets to zero.  \n \n4.  When your opponent is on two fouls : before your opponent shoots, you o r a referee \nmust warn them that they are on two fouls, and they must acknowledge the warning.   If \nthe warning is not issued and the y foul on their next shot:  \n \na. it is not considered a third successive foul;  \nb. they incur the normal penalty for a foul, but no t the penalty for three \nsuccessive fouls;  \nc. their foul count remains at two.  \n \n1-23 Calling Fouls  / Foul s Not Called  \n \n1.  A foul may only be called by a player playing in the game or by a referee that has  \nbeen properly called to the ta ble.  See Rule 1.41, Coaching, for more information  \nconcerning exceptions in team play.   (AR p. 8 9) \n \n2.  Any foul not called before the next stroke is taken is considered to have not occurred .  \nThe failure to call a foul on any previous shot does not restr ict the ability to call a similar \nfoul on any future shot.  \n \n1-24 Multiple Fouls  \n \nIf you commit more than one foul during a shot, only the foul that carries the most severe \npenalty is enforced.  H owever, unsports manlike conduct may be penalized in conjunction \nwith any foul or violation. (AR  p. 90) \n \n1-25 One Foot on the Floor  \n \nIt is a foul if you do not have at least one foot in contact with the floor when the cue tip \nstrikes the cue ball.   Footwear  must be worn and be normal with regard to size, shape, \nand manner of wear.  \n \n1-26 Balls in Motion  \n \nIt is a foul if you shoot while any ball on the table  is in motion.  A spinning ball is in \nmotion.  \n \n \n \n \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL  \n 33 Approximately 7 inches  Original position \nof disturbed ball . \nDiagram 6 \u2013 Area Originally Occupied by Disturbed Ball  1-27 Scratch  \n \nIt is a foul if you scratch.  \n \n1-28 Jumped Balls  \n \nIt is a foul if you cause any ball to be jumped off the table. (AR p. 90) \n \n1-29 Push Shot  \n \nIt is a foul if you shoot a push shot.  \n \n1-30 Double Hit (AR p. 90) \n \n1.  It is a foul if your cue tip strikes the cue ball more than once on a single shot.   \n \n2.  It is a foul if your cue tip is still in contact with the cue ball when the cue ball strikes \nan object ball.  However, such a s troke may be considered legal if the object ball is legal \nand cue ball strikes it at a very fine angle .   \n \n1-31 Simultaneous Hit  \n \n(Material moved to Rule 1 -19-1. No change in content.)  \n \n1-32 Miscue s \n  \nA miscue is not  necessarily  a foul.  (AR p. 90) \n \n1-33 Disturbed Ball s  (Cue Ball Fouls Only) (AR p. 9 1) \n \n1.  During a game,  it is not a foul if you accidentally touch or move  a single  stationary  \nobject ball  with any part  of your body, clothing or equipment , unless the disturbed ball \nhas an effect on the outcome of the shot.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2.  \"Effect on the outcome of the shot \" means that either the d isturbed ball contact s any \nball set in motion as a result of the shot, or that the base of any ball set in motion as a \nresult of the shot passes through the area originally occupied by the disturbed ball.  That \narea is defined as a circle approximately sev en inches in diameter centered on the \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL  \n 34 position originally occupied by the disturbed ball (see Diagram  6). \n \n3.  If a disturbed ball  has no effect o n the outcome of the shot, your opponent has the \noption to leave the disturbed ball where it came to rest or to restore  it to its original \nposition  before the next shot .  If the disturbed ball is to be restored, a referee m ay restore \nit, your opponent may restore it, or you may restore it with your opponent\u2019s permission.  \nIt is a foul if you touch or restore the disturbed ball without your opponent's permission.  \n \n4.  It is a foul if a disturbed ball has  an effect on the outc ome of the shot .  Your opponent \nhas no restoration option.    \n \n5.  If you disturb a single object ball and, in the same shot, commit a foul that is not \nrelated to the disturbed ball: you are penalized for the foul,  and your opponent has the \nrestoration option for the disturbed ball that was not involved in the foul.  \n \n6.  If a single disturbed ball falls into a pocket with no effect on the outcome of a shot, \nyour opponent has the restoration option.  However, if the disturbed ball is designated by \nspecific game rules as the game winning ball, it must be restored.   If the game -winning  \nball is disturbed and falls into a pocket when there is an effect on the outcome of the shot,  \nit is loss of ga me. \n \n7.  It is a foul if: \n \na. you disturb the cue ball ; \nb. you disturb more than one object ball ;  \nc. a disturbed ball contacts any other ball;  \nd. you disturb a ball that is in motion . \n \nYour opponent has no restoration option .  If the game -winning ball is disturbed in  \nconjunction with a violation of (a) through (d) and falls into a pocket, it is loss of game.  \n \n1-34 Jump Shot s and Mass\u00e9 Shot s \n \n1.  Jump shots are legal shots.  However, it is a foul if you intentionally cause the cue ball \nto rise off the bed of the table by \"digging under\" or \"scooping\" the cue ball with the cue.  \nIf such a motion is unintentional, it is considered a miscue, and not a foul in and of itself.   \n(AR p. 90) \n \n2.  If you attempt to jump over or mass\u00e9 around an impeding  illegal object ball  then Rule \n1-33, Disturbed Ball s, does not apply to the impeding ball for that shot.  If the impeding \nillegal o bject ball moves during the stroke it is a foul regardless of whet her it was moved \nby your equipment or any part of your body.  \n \n1-35 Position of Ball  \n \nThe position of a ball  is determined by its base  (see Diagr am 7). \n \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL  \n 35  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1-36 Shooting with Ball in Hand  Behind the Head String  (AR p. 95) \n \n1.  When you have ball in hand behind the head str ing, it is a foul if the first ball \ncontacted by the cue ball is behind the head string unless, before contacting that ball, you \nfirst shoot the cue ball past the head string and it contacts a cushion  at a point below the \nhead string.  \n \n2.  It is a foul if, before contacting the first object ball, the first cushion contacted by the \ncue ball is behind the head string.  \n \n3.  When you have ball in hand behind the head string, it is a foul if you place the ball \noutside of the kitchen and shoot.  \n \n1-37 (Reserved for Future Use)  \n \n1-38 Ball in Hand  Placement  \n \n1.  When you have ball in hand, you may use your hand or any part of your cue, including \nthe tip, to position the cue ball.  If you  use your cue to place the cue ball, any action that \nwould be a legal stroke will be considered a shot, and must meet the requirements of a \nlegal shot or it is a foul.  (AR p. 81, 96) \n \n2.  Once you have picked up or moved  the cue ball to take ball in hand , it remains in hand \nuntil it is contacted by the tip on your next stroke .  You may place the cue ball, pick it up \nor move  it again, and replace it successive  times until you take that stroke.  (AR p. 9 6) \n \n3.  Immedi ately after a foul, when you are picking up or moving  the cue ball the first time \nto take ball in hand (as opposed to placing the cue ball or picking it up again for \nsuccessive placements before the next shot), the provisions of Rule 1 -33-1 apply to \ntouchi ng or disturb ing a single object ball with the cue ball or your hand.  You may \nrequest that a referee  pick the cue ball up for you immediately after a foul.  (AR p. 9 6) \n Head String  Example: \nBall is in  \nthe kit chen.

When placing or moving  the cue ball, it is a  foul  if you touch or disturb any object \nball with the cue ball or your hand that holds the cue ball .  Your \"hand\" is defined as \nincluding the wrist up to a point where a wristwatch would normally be worn.  Your \noppone nt has no restoration option.  \n \n1-39 Marking the Table  \n \nIt is a foul if you intentionally mark the table in any way to assist you in executing any \nshot or future shot.   Marking includes the deliberate placemen t of chalk  or any other \nobject at a specific point on a rail or cushion to aid the alignment of a shot, or placing any \nmark on any part of the table.  The foul occurs at the moment you mark the table, \nregardless of whether you remove the mark  or whether a shot is taken.  \n \n1-40 Deliberate Foul  \n \nDuring a game, it is a deliberate foul  if you commit any of the following acts , whether \nshooting or not.   In addition to the penalties under the Gener al Rules and specific game \nrules, you incur additional penalties if indicated , and upon the first violation you will \nreceive a mandatory warning that second and subsequent violations of the same sub -\nsection during the match will be penalized by loss of gam e. (Exception: see Rule 6.17 for \npenalties in 14.1 Continuous.)  \n \na. Deflecting c ue ball  on a break shot : After a stroke on a break shot, \nincluding  a miscue, it  is a deliberate foul if you intentionally touch or \ndeflect the cue ball.  The break is illegal, regardless of whether the cue ball \ncontacts the rack, or whether specific game rules for break shots are met. \nYour opponent may either re -rack and break or req uire you to re -rack and \nbreak again.  (Exception: no re -rack in 9 -Ball or 10 -ball.)  \nb. Cue ball:  It is a deliberate foul if you intentionally:  \n1) strike, move or deflect the cue ball with anything other than your cue \ntip (except when you have ball in hand);  \n2) pick up or contact the cue ball while it or any other ball is in motion ; \n3) end your inning by picking up the cue ball, or by refusing to shoot \n(AR p. 9 7); \n4) cause the cue ball to move  by contacting or moving any part of the \ntable in any way.  (AR p. 9 7) \nc. Object balls:  It is a deliberate foul i f you i ntentionally stop or deflect any \nobject ball that is in motion , or intentionally move  any stationary object \nball that is in play , by any method other than a legal shot, including by \nintentionally contacting or moving any part of the table in any way.   (AR \np. 91) \n Penalties First violation of (c ): your opponent may have the object ball \nrestored (if it was stationary),  pocketed or left in its position  after the foul .  \nHowever, i t is loss of game if it is the game -winning ball , if any deflected \nobject ball contacts any other ball , or if more than one ball is moved.  \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL  \n 37 d. Placing hand in pocket:   It is a deliberate foul i f you c atch any ball that is \nfalling into a pocket , or p lace your hand into a pocket while any ball in \nplay is in motion near that pocket.   (AR p. 9 7) \n First violation of (d ): if the cue ball, ball in hand.  If an object ball, your \nopponent may have the ball placed along the lip of the pocket, pocketed, \nor left in position.   However, i t is loss of game if the ball involved is the \ngame winning  ball.  (8 -Ball exception for first violation: if the 8 -ball is \ninvolved and it is th e break shot, it is not loss of game ). \n1-41 Coaching   \n \n1.  During your match, it is a foul if you ask for , or intentionally receive , assistance in \nplanning or executing any shot.   \n \n2.  It is a foul if you receive unsolicited assistance from a spectator associated with you \n(e.g., spouse/partner, relative, teammate).  \u201cAssistance\u201d includes being alerted to an \nopponent\u2019s foul.  \n \n3.  If you are not aware of an opponent\u2019s foul, and you are alerted to the foul by \nunsolicited information from a spectator not associated with you, the foul is not \nenforceable but you do not incur any additional penalty.  \n \nException: In scotch doubles or team play, a violation of Rule 1.8, No Practice Allowed \nDuring Match, may be called on any member of the opponent\u2019s team by any member of \nthe offended team, regardless of whether they or the offending player are at the table or \ninvolved in a game.  Other modifications of Rule 1 -41 concerning team or doubles play \nmay be made by the Administrative Authority . \n \n4.  Any spectator not associated with you  who offers any significant unsolicited \nassistance to you, whether verbal or non -verbal, will be warned against further  \ninterruptions or  removed from the area.  \n \n5.  The Administrative Authority  of the event may modify this rule for team or doubles \nplay. (AR p. 9 7) \n \n1-42 Non-Shooting Player  Requirement  \n \n1.  It is unspor tsmanlike conduct  if you intentionally distract your opponent or interfere \nwith their play. (AR p. 82, 98, 99) \n \n2.  The non -shooting player has an obligation to pay attention to the game on the table, \nwhich includes clearly and unambiguously acknowledging called shots and safeties.  In \nthe event of a dispute over whether a shot or safety was properly called, the referee is the \nsole judge.  \n \n3.  If asked, t he non -shooting player  must provide information to you concerning the \ngame on the table (e.g., who has which group in 8 -Ball, or  whether they committed a \nfoul, etc.).   \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL  \n 38  \nIf, as the non -shooting player, you do provide information to your opponent, you must do \nso in g ood faith and, to the best of your ability, provide correct information.  The non -\nshooting player is not protected by Rule 1 -1-2 from giving incorrect information, and \nmay incur penalties by giving incorrect information.  (AR p. 9 8) \n \n1-43 Concession  of Game  \n \n1.  You must not concede any game at any time for any reason.  \u201cConcede\u201d means that , \nas a result of any verbal or non -verbal action, you lead your opponent to belie ve that you \nare awarding them the game before its normal conclusion on the table.  Before a game \nhas ended, you must refrain from making any statements such as \u201cgood game\u201d, etc., or \nany other verbal inference that the game is over or that your opponent is certain or likely \nto win.  You must also refrain from any similar non -verbal action, such as putting away \nyour cue or accessory items, beginning to mark a score sheet, changing clothes, retrieving \nor juggling coins or tokens, etc.  Whether or not you have conceded a game is determined \nsolely by the referee\u2019s judgment.  \n \n2.  If you concede a game, in addition to losing that game you will receive a mandatory \nwarning  against  further concessions.  A second violation results in the los s of the \nconceded game and a n additional  deduction of one game from your score (if you have \nzero games, your score would be \"minus one game\") and a final mandatory warning.  A \nthird violation results in loss of match.  In team play, any member of the team may \ncommit the second or third violations. (AR p. 9 8) \n \n3. In the absence of any act by your opponent judged to be a concession under Rule 1 -43-\n1, you must not assume that your opponent has conceded the game.  If you d isturb  the \nposition of  the table in suc h a situation, then you are charged with a concession violation .  \n(AR p. 9 8) \n \n4.  If you disturb the position of the table in an act that presumes the game is over before \nit is actually over, such as gathering balls together to rack the next game, you lose  the \ngame.  (AR p. 9 8) \n \n1-44 Concession  of Match  \n \nWhen your opponent is on the hill , if you make a motion to unscrew your playing cue \nduring your opponent's inning you lose the match.

A player\u2019s patte rn of  \nbehavior from prior events may also be considered.  \n \n4.  A foul with a specified progression of penalties may have a more serious penalty \napplied early in the progression if it is committed willfully or in an unsportsmanlike \nmanner, or if it is commit ted intentionally in consecutive matches.  \n \n5.

If other balls interfere with spotting, the ball(s) to be spotted will be placed on the long \nstring below the foot s pot, but as close as possible to the foot spot, without moving the \ninterfering balls. If there is no space available on the long string below the foot spot, they \nwill be placed on the long string above the foot spot, but as close as possible to the foot \nspot, without moving the interfering balls  (see Diagram 9) . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3.  Whenever possible, spotted balls will be placed frozen to interfering object balls or \nother spotted balls.  If the cue ball is the interfering ball, the spotted ball wi ll be placed as \nclosely as possible to the cue ball without being frozen to it. (AR p. 101) \n \n1-47 Jawed Ball s \n \nIf balls are wedged in the mouth of a pocket , a referee will inspect them and judge \nwhethe r, if they were free to fall directly downward, the balls would come to rest on the \nbed of the table or in the pocket.  The referee will then place the balls in the positions as \njudged and play will continue.   \n \n1-48 Non-Player Interference  \n \nIf balls move because of the action of a non -player or other influence beyond the control \nof the players, a referee will restore  the balls as nearly as possible to their original \npositions and play will continue.  If the interference occurs during a shot and has an \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL  \n 41 effect on the outcome of the shot, the shooter  shoot s again  after the restoration .  In either \ncase, if the referee judges that restoration is not possible, the game will be replayed with \nthe player who b roke the game breaking again.  Balls moved under such circumstances \ndo not meet the definition of disturbed balls  and Rule 1 -33 does not apply.  (AR p. 101) \n \n \n1-49 Balls Settling  or Moving  \n \n1.  If a ball settles  or otherwise moves by itself, it will remain in the position it assumed \nand play continues.  It is not a foul if a ball settles or otherwise moves by itself as you are \nshooting.  If a ball that you are shooting at settles while you are shooting but does n ot fall \ninto a pocket, the result of the shot stands.  \n \n2.  If a ball that is frozen  to the cue ball moves as the cue ball leaves its original position \non a shot, whether or not it was moved by the cue ball or settled on its own is determined \nsolely by the referee's judgment.  \n \n3.  If a ball  is hanging on the lip of a pocket and falls into that pocket by itself after being \nstationary for five seconds or longer, it will be replaced as clo sely as possible to the \nposition it was in prior to falling.   The five -second count does not begin until all balls in  \nplay have stopped moving.   Whether the shooter remains at the table does not affect the  \nfive-second period.  \n \n4.  If a hanging ball drops into a pocket by itself while balls are in motion during a shot , \nthe ruling depends on the ensuing action of the balls:  \n \na. If no ball passes through the area originally occupied by the hanging ball, \nit is restored and play will continue.  \nb. If the cue ball, bef ore contacting another ball, passes through the area \noriginally occupied by the hanging ball and, without contacting any other \nballs, either scratches or remains on the table, both the cue ball and the \nobject ball are restored to their prior positions and you shoot again. (AR p. \n101) \nc. If the shot is legal and any ball passes through the area originally occupied \nby the hanging ball, including the cue ball with or without scratching, and \nany other balls are contacted by such a ball at any point during the shot , a \nreferee will attempt to restore the position prior to the shot and you shoot \nagain.  If restoration is not possible, the game will be replayed with the \nplayer who broke the game breaking again. (AR p. 101) \nd. If the shot is illegal because the cue ball fi rst contacts an illegal object ball \nbefore it or any other ball passes through the area originally occupied by \nthe hanging ball, it is a foul.  The incoming player accepts the object balls \nin position.  If the hanging ball is designated by specific game ru les as the \ngame winning ball it must be restored, otherwise it is not restored.  \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL  \n 42 \nApex \nOne solid and one stripe, \nleft/right orientation does \nnot matter.

I f you do not legally pocket a ball or \nyou commit a foul, your inning ends.  (AR p. 102) \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL  \n 43 2.  If you intend to break softly , you must notify your opponent and allow them the \nopportunity to call a referee to watch your break.  If you fail to notify your opponent you \nwill receive a mandatory warning on the first offense.  Second and subsequent offenses \nare fouls.  \n \n3.  If your break is illegal , with or without a foul, your inning ends.  Your opponent may : \n \na. re-rack the balls  and break;  \nb. require you to re -rack the balls and break again ; \n  \nThe game cannot continue until  there is a legal break.  If your opponent\u2019s  break is illegal \nand there is also a foul, the illegal break takes precedence and you must choose either \noption (a) o r (b) above . \n \n4.  If you foul on a legal break  and do not pocket the 8 -ball, your inning ends and any \nother pocketed object balls remain pocketed.  Your opponent receives  ball in hand  \nanywhere on the table . \n  \n5.  In all cases o n the break, jumped object balls other than the 8 -ball are not returned to \nthe table except in the case of a re -rack.  If the 8 -ball is jumped it is spotted.  \n \n2-4 8-Ball Pocketed on the Break  (AR p. 102) \n \n1.  If you pocket the 8 -ball on the break and do not  foul, you may:  \n \na. have the 8 -ball spotted and  accept the table in position ; \nb. re-rack the balls and break again.  \n \n2.

When the table is open, all object balls except the 8 -ball are legal object \nballs .  For combinat ion shots , a ball of one group may be contacted first to pocket a ball \nof the other group.   The 8 -ball may be part of such a combination if it is not the first ball \ncontacted by the cue ball.  \n  \n \n \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL  \n 44 2-6 Establishing Groups  \n \n1.  Groups  are established when the first object ball is legally pocketed on a shot after the \nbreak.  The player legally pocketing the first ball is assigned that group, and the opponent \nis assigned the other group.   You cannot  establish  a group  on a safet y. (AR p. 102) \n \n2.  If all balls of either group  are pocketed on the break or illegally pocketed before \ngroups are established, either player may legally shoot the 8 -ball during their inn ing.  \nYou win the game i f you legally pocket the 8 -ball on such a shot. \n \n3.  Once  they are established, groups can never change for the remainder of that game.  If \na player shoots the wrong group  and no foul is called before the next shot and the player \ncontinues to shoot at t hat g roup, or if at any  time during th e game it is discovered by \neither  player or a referee that the players are shooting the wrong groups, the game will be \nreplayed with the player who broke the game breaking again . If a game has ended and \nthen the players rea lize they shot the wrong groups, the game is not replayed and the \nresult stands.  \n \n2-7 Continuing Play  \n \n1.  Once groups are established, play continues with each player having their group as \nlegal object balls.  Balls in your opponents' group and the 8 -ball are illegal object balls.  \nWhen it is your inning, you continue to shoot as long as you legally pocket a ball on each \nshot.   Object balls pocketed in addition to the called ball remain pocketed.   Your inning \nends if you do not legally pocket a ball.  \n \n2.  Jumped object balls  and illegally pocketed ball s are not returned to the table  but do \ncount in favor of the player with that group.  \n \n2-8 Safety Play  \n \nPrior  to any shot except the break,  you may declare a safety.  On a safety, your inning \nends after the shot regardless of whether you pocket  any ball .  If you do not declare a \nsafety  and you pocket a  ball o n an obvious shot, your inning continues and you must \nshoot again.  A safety mus t meet the requirements of Rule 1.19, Legal S hot, or it is a foul . \n(AR p. 77, 103) \n \n2-9 Shooting the 8 -Ball \n \n1.  The 8 -ball becomes your legal object ball on your first shot after the re are no  balls of \nyour group on the t able.  The player who  legally pocket s the 8 -ball wins the game.  (AR p. \n103) \n \n2.  With the exception of the provisions of Rule 2.10, it is not loss of game if you fo ul \nwhen shooting the 8 -ball but do not pocket the 8 -ball.

    "content": "BANK POOL  \n \n7-1 The Game  \n \n1.  Bank Pool  (also called  \u201cBanks\u201d ) is a call shot game  played with fifteen object balls, \nnumbered 1 th rough 15, plus a cue ball in the long rack game, and any nine object balls \nplus a cue ball in the short rack game.   To score you are required to play a bank shot.   \nThe object of the game is to score a predetermined number of balls before your opponent \ndoes. The game is played by two, three, four or five players.  Two players may play \neither a long rack or short rack game.  For three, four or five  players, the long rac k game \nis the suggested format.  \n \n7-2 The Rack  \n \nThe balls are racked  as follows (see Figure 7 -1): \n \na. in long rack bank pool, in  a triangle and placed randomly;  \nb. in short rack bank pool, in a diamond (shaded  area in Figure 7 -1) and \nplaced randomly;  \nc. the apex ball on the foot spot  (AR p. 84); \nd. the rows behind the apex are parallel  to the foot string.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7-3 Break Requirement s \n \n1.  You begin t he break  with cue ball in hand behind the head string.  There is no \nrequirement to contact any particular object ball first.  You must cause  at least four ob ject \nballs to contact the cushions or it is an illegal  break .  If any balls are pocketed on the \nopening break, you continue shooting.  Any balls pocketed on t he opening break are not \nscored  and are spotted after your inning ends.  \n \n2.  If your break is ille gal, your opponent may:  \n \na. accept the table in position, or;  \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL  \n 61 b. re-rack the balls and break.  \n \n7-4 Breaking Subsequent Racks  \n \nIf a match consists of multiple games, players must alternate breaking  subsequent games . \n \n7-5 Continuing Play  \n \nAll object balls are lega l.  Your inning continues as long as you l egally pocket a ball .  \nYour inning ends if you do not legally pocket a ball.  \n \n7-6 Scoring  \n \nA legally pocketed ball  counts as one ball.  Any ball pocketed in addition to the called \nball on the same shot does not count and is an illegally pocketed ball.  \n \n7-7 Legally Pocketed Ball  \n \n1.  A ball is leg ally pocketed  if: \n \na. it is pocketed as the result of a bank shot;  \nb. the number of cushions are designated when call ing the shot and only that \nnumber of cushions are contacted;  \nc. it is not pocketed as a result of a kiss or carom;  \nd. it is not contacted by the cue ball more  than once.  \n \n2.  Contact with a cushion means that the called ball has made contact with a cushion \ndesig nated as a part of the called bank shot.  Incidental contact with a cushion as the \nobject ball approaches the called pocket is not considered contacting an extra cushion that \nwould disqualify a shot from being legal based on the number of called cushions.  \n \n7-8 Illegally Pocketed Ball  \n \nA ball is illegally pocketed if the shot does not meet the requirements of Rule 7-6, if it is \npocketed in addition to the called ball , or if a foul is committed on the shot.  \n \n7-9 Jump Shot Requirement  \n \nJump shots  may only be attempted with your playing cue.  \n \n7-10 Foul Penalty  \n \n1.  For each foul  you commit you must spot one of your previously scored balls, reducing \nyour score by one.  (AR p. 104) \n \n2.  If you foul and have no previously scored object balls, you \u201cowe \u201d one for that foul and \nmust spot balls after each scoring inning until all \u201cowed balls\u201d are eliminated.  \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL  \n 62 3.  Your opponent accepts the cue ball in position, unless the re is a scratch  or it is jumped \noff the t able.  \n \n7-11 Scratch or Cue Ball Jumped Off Table  \n \nIt is a foul if you scratch or jump the cue ball o ff the table.  Your opponent receives  ball \nin hand behind the head string.  \n \n7-12 Jumped Balls  \n \nIt is a foul if you jump  an object ball off the table.  The object ball is spotte d and y our \nopponent accepts the cue ball in position.    \n \n7-13 Illegally Pocketed Balls \u2013 Spotting Requirements  \n \nAll illeg ally pocketed  balls are spotted, but  spotting is delayed until the shooter\u2019s inning \nends.  If you score the last ball remaining on the table but have not yet won the game, any \nillegally pocketed balls being held for spotti ng are then spotted at once and your inning  \ncontinues . \n \n7.14 Spotting Forgotten Balls  \n \nIf both players agree, forgotten balls  may be spotted at any time after they are \nremembered.  If either player objects to the earlier spotting then any owed balls are \nspotted after the end of the next player\u2019s inning.  However, if there are no balls left on the \ntable and the game has not been won, then all forgotten balls must be spotted \nimmediately.  \n \n7-15 All Remaining Balls are  Behind the Head String with Cue  \n Ball in Hand Behind the Head String  \n \nWhen you have cue ball in hand behind the head string and all remaining balls are also \nbehind the head string, the object ball nearest the head string may be spotted upon your \nrequest.  If two or more balls at an equal distance from the head string are nearest the \nhead string, you may choose which ball to spot.  \n \n7-16 End of Game  \n  \n1.  For two players, the game ends when:  \n \na. in a long rack game, one player has legally poc keted eight balls and does \nnot owe  any balls;  \nb. in a short rack game, one player has legally pocket ed five balls and does \nnot owe  any balls.   \n \n2.  For three, four or five players, the long rack game ends when one player has legally \npocketed five, four, or three balls, respect ively, and does not owe any balls.  \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL  \n 63 RULES SECTION 8"

The information in this section carries the same \neffect as the General Rules, and the procedures described are mandatory and binding on \nreferees and event officials. \nA referee\u2019s role is to ensure that a level playing field exists for all competitors by \nmaintaining order and enforcing the rules of the game.  Their primary responsibility is to \nserve the needs of the players.   \n10-1 Authority of the CSI Referee \n1. CSI referees are the direct representatives of CSI in all matters concerning the conduct\nof the actual game on the table and the comportment of the players and spectators during\nCSI events.\n2. A CSI referee is the final authority in all matters of judgment.  Matters of judgment\ninclude whether:\na. a stroke or hit was legal or illegal;\nb. a ball did or did not contact a cushion;\nc. a ball is frozen to a cushion or another ball;\nd. a ball is in a certain position with respect to any rule, such as in or out of\nthe kitchen or rack, winner of a lag, etc.;\ne. a shot was considered to be obvious (within the constraints of Rule 1-16 );\nf. a position can be restored;\ng. the position of restored balls is accurate;\nh. the table was illegally marked;\ni. the rack is suitable for play;\nj. equipment or conditions are suitable for pla y;\nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL  \n 68 k. outside interference has occurred;  \nl. coaching has occurred;  \nm. a player meets dress code requirements;  \nn. a player's conduct is unsportsmanlike.  \n \nThis list is not necessarily all-inclusive . \n \n3.  A CSI referee has the authority to:  \n \na. suspend play;  \nb. warn, penalize or disqualify players for rules infractions;  \nc. if necessary, request players to take specific actions  (AR p. 104); \nd. request removal of persons other than players  who disrupt or interfere with \nplay.  \n \n4.  A referee\u2019s authority  extends  to the entire event venue at any time the referee is in \nuniform.  A CSI referee\u2019s authority is also held by other event officials  other than the \nfinal protest authority , as designated by the Administrative Authority of that event, \nwhether in uniform or no t. \n \n10-2 Answering Players\u2019 Questions  and Assisting Players  \n \n1.  A referee must answer  all players' questions regarding the CSI Rules , subject to  the \nfollowing guidelines:  \n \na. A referee must provide only factual informatio n.  Examples include, but \nare not limited to:  \n(1) how many games are needed to win the match;  \n(2) what the penalty is for a specific rules infraction;  \n(3) what rule would apply if a specific shot were  taken . \n \nb. A re feree must never offer or provide an  opinion concerning  subjective \ninformation that would affect play.  Examples include, but are not limited \nto: \n(1) whether a legal hit can be made , or what method or type of stroke \nmight be used to execute a shot, unless the matter is specifically \nreferred to in a rule and theref ore required  to be explained under Rule  \n10-2-1-a; (AR p. 105) \n(2) whether a ball will fit through a gap;  \n(3) how the characteristics of the table might affect  play.  \n \nc. If a player, after receiving either factual information  or rules information \nfrom a referee, change s their mind about how to proceed with their game \nor what shot to take, the information provided is not considered to have \naffected play under the provisions of Rule 10-2-1-b. \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL  \n 69  \n2.  For issues concerning the conduct of the game on the table, referees are no t permitted \nto approach a table based on a request from anyone other than the players involved in the \ngame.  If you require information from a referee during a match, you must make the \nrequest yourself.  If a referee determines that such a question asked b y a person who is \nnot a player in a match pertains to a match in progress, they will not answer the quest ion, \nor go to the table unless properly called by a player involved . \n \n3. Referees will assist players with equipment as follows:  \n \na. they will help player s locate and retrieve chalk when it is supplied by the \nAdministrative Authority;  \nb. they will retrieve a mechanical bridge upon request, but may not assist the \nplayer in the use of the bridge.  After the shot, they will take the \nmechanical bridge from the pla yer upon request.  \n \n10-3 Calling Fouls  \n \n1.  Referees will call fouls  as soon as possible after they occur.  \n \n2.  Whe n called to a table, a referee wil l call all fouls that occur while the referee is at the \ntable.  \n \n3.  When maki ng a ruling, a referee will announce the ruling and, if calling a foul, a brief \ndescription of the foul or rule that was violated.  Some examples are:  \n \n\u201cGood hit\u201d  \n\u201cFoul \u2013 double hit \u201d; \n\u201cFoul \u2013 no cushion after contact \u201d; \n\u201cFoul \u2013 contacted the 3 -ball first\u201d (if the 3 -ball was an  illegal object ball);  \n\"Foul \u2013 object ball jumped off table\".  \n \nWhen a scratch occurs  or if the cue ball is jumped off the table , it is not necessary for the \nreferee to announce a foul or the basis  for the  foul. \n \n4.  In the matter of jud gment  calls as referred to in Rule 10-1, a referee is not responsible \nfor explaining  to a player what methods were used to determine a  ruling.  At their \ndiscretion, a referee may briefly describe the violatio n, but they are not responsible for \ngiving a player a detailed description of how the ruling was determined.  \n \n5.  After calling a foul that results in ball in hand, the referee will pick up or retrieve the \ncue ball and hand it to the incoming player.  \n \n6.  A referee will not call  a foul or penalize a player in a dispute over  a shot that w as \nunseen  by the referee if the call would have been a judgment ca ll and the referee cannot \nclearly determine that a foul oc curred.   However, if the unseen act  involves a rules \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL \n70 application, then referees and event officials will make every reasonable effort to ensure \nthat the correct and appropriate ruling is made. \n7. A referee will not call a foul unless, in their judgment, they have clear evidence of a\nfoul.  If the referee is not certain of the outcome of a shot or situation, the following\nguidelines are provided concerning various rules and their Applied Rulings:\n1-2-2 No foul. \nRule When in question, presumption on situation seen \n1-3 Equipment is legal. \n1-3-c through g No foul.   Warning to use caution may be issued. \n1-4 The cue is legal. \n1-8 No foul. \n1.11 Time limits are not exceeded. \n1.14 Rack is acceptable.   Warning to use caution may be issued. \n1-15 The shot is executed in time. \n1-16, 1-42 The shot or safety was properly called.   Warning to use \ncare in calling shots and acknowledging calls must be \nissued to both players. \n1-18, 1-19 The stroke or shot is legal. \n1-25 The foot is in contact with the floor. \n1-26 The ball is not in motion. \n1-29, 1-30 , 1-32 The shot is legal. \n1-33-2 There is no effect on the outcome of the shot. \n1-39, 1-41, 1- 42 Marking, coaching or interference has not occurred. \nWarning to use caution may be issued. \n1-43, 1-44 Concession has not occurred. \n1-45 penalty Issue a more lenient penalty and unequivocal warning \nrather than a more severe penalty. \n2.8, 6.11 The safety was called.  Warning to use care in  \ncalling and acknowledging safeties must  be issued to both  \nplayers. \nTo emphasize, the above listed information is intended as guidance for officials, and is \nirrelevant if the referee is certain in their judgment that a situation has occurred.   Once a \nruling has been made by an official, players may not use the provisions of this rule to \nattempt to influence the  decision.  \n8. When a referee is not present, a foul may only be called by a player involved in the\ngame.  See Rule 1.41, Coaching, for more detail and for team play exceptions.\n10-4 Responsibility for Multiple Tables / Referee Presiding  \n1. CSI events are usually played with referees having responsibility for more than one\ntable.   In that situation, the following procedures apply:\na. Referees will not make any calls concerning the game on the table unless\nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL  \n 71 they have been properly called to the table by a player  involved in the \ngame . Exception: Unsportsmanlike Conduct may be called without having \nbeen called to the table.  \nb. A referee observing a foul before being called to  a table may use that \nknowledge to call the foul if called to the table after the foul. The foul may \nnot be called if the referee is not called to the table before the next shot.  \nc. \u201cProperly called to the table\u201d means that the player requesting the \nreferee\u2019 s presence has complied with the requirements of Rule 1 -9.  If a \nreferee that is summoned by a player observes the player\u2019s opponent \nalready down on a shot, the referee will not attempt to interrupt or stop the \nplayer .  \nd. If a referee observes a player about  to commit an act that would be a foul, \nthe referee will take no action to alert the player or stop the foul from \nbeing committed , regardless of whether they have been properly called to \nthe table.   Exception: after the referee has arrived at the table  and before \nthe shooter is down on a shot, if the shooter starts to proceed before the \nreferee has authorized them to shoot, the referee will request the shooter to \nnot proceed until authorized.  (AR p. 107) \ne. When approaching a table to stop or suspend play for reasons other than \nbeing summoned by a player, a referee will not interrupt a player down on \na shot, but rather will wait until that shot is completed before intervening.  \nf. When directed by Administrative Authority, referees may  come to the \ntable without hav ing been called in order to enforce items such as dress \ncode or other violations of event regulations.  \n \n2.  After having been properly c alled to a table,  the referee takes over the  responsibilities \nand duties of the non -shooting player,  including acknowled ging called  shots or safeties.  \nThe non -shooting player must leave the table while their opponent is shooting, and does \nnot necessarily have the right to occupy any particular position away from the table other \nthan being in the chair.     \n \n3.  When a refer ee is presiding over a match, the referee will make all cal ls concerning \nthe match , and no request by the players is necessary .  However, p layers may still request \nspecific information from the referee as necessary.  \n \n10-5 Protests, Rules Interpretations, a nd Final Authority  \n \n1.  You may protest  if you feel a referee has incorrectly applied the rules or made an \nincorrect rules interpretation.  You must make your protest both immediately  after the \ndecision in question, and prior to the next shot being taken, or it will not be considered.  \nReferees must honor your request , suspend play, and inform their supervisor or the \nappropriate event official  of the protest.  \n \n2.  Matters involving a referee\u2019s judgment ma y not be protested.  \n \n3.  The Tournament Director or other designated event  official is the final authority on all \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL  \n 72 protests.  The y may, and should , consult with the senior referee present and other referees \nas necessary to gather information relative to the  protest and for technical assistance if \ndesired.  However, n o final decision on any protest may be made by any CSI referee \nwhile acting in the capacity of a referee.  Any person holding final protest authority must \navoid acting as a referee.  \n4.  Whenever p ossible , referees faced with unusual situations  not specifically covered by \nthe CSI rules must  first look to the event s\u2019 Administrati ve Authority  for guidance before \nmaking a ruling.  The tournament director or other designated event  official with final \nprotest authority i s responsible for making  rules interpretations in unusual situations .   \n \n5.  If you have a specific issue concerning a referee\u2019s conduct that is not related to a \njudgment call or rules issue, you should contact the Administrative Authority  or Head \nReferee of the event , or the CSI National Office . \n \n10-6 Soliciting Information  \n \n1.  Referees may solicit information  from any source to aid them in making their \ndecision s. (AR p. 107) \n \n2.  If ruling on a sit uation or issue which occurred while a referee was not present, the \nreferee will make their best effort to gather the appropriate information required to render \na decision, and will make the ir decision based on that information.  However, players are \nultim ately responsible for ensuring that they provide referees with all relevant \ninformation, and the referee is not resp onsible for information that is  not offered or \nobtained.  As in all other cases  involving referees\u2019 decisions , after another shot has been \ntaken no previous ruling may be changed or protested, even if it is later discovered that \nthe referee had incomplete or incorrect information at the time of the ruling.  \n \n10-7 Suitability of Equipment  \n \nReferees will make their best effort to ensure that the tournament equipment is suitable  \nfor p lay and meets CSI requirements.  During play, players may ask a referee to clean one \nor more balls, remove excess powder from the table bed or rails, or assist in any other \nway to keep the equipment playable.  \n \n10-8 Penalizing Unsportsmanlike Conduct  \n \nReferees are obligated to ensure that players do not engage in  any act or activity that, in \nthe referee\u2019s judgment, is unsportsmanlike in nature.  This includes, but is not limited  to: \nactions that are embarrassing, disrupt ive, or detrimental to other players, spectators, \nreferees, event officials, or the sport in general , or any act that makes a travesty of the \ngame .  \n \n10-9 Authority to Alter Rules  \n \nThe Administrative Authority  of an event may alter the  CSI rules as necessary.  If they \nchoose to alter the rules in any way, the Administrative Authority must make a \nreasonable effort to ensure that:  \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL  \n 73  \na. all players affected by the alteration are properly notified  in a timely \nmanner ; \nb. the alterations are available to the affected players in writing;  \nc. the alterations are properly detailed and complete;  \nd. if requested, the alterations are provided to the CSI National Office.  \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL  \n 74 RULES SECTION 1 1"

    "content": "DEFINITIONS AND DIAGRAMS  \n \nBall in Hand  \n \nSee AR 1.38, Ball in Hand Placement  \n \nBank Shot ; Carom  Shot ; Combination Shot ; Kick Shot ; Kiss Shot  \n \nAlthough t he definitions for these shots refer to the \"called ball\", naturally these types of \nshots exist in games that are not call shot games.  The references to the called ball in \nthese definitions are specifically to s upport and emphasize the restrictions placed on th ese \ntypes of shots under Rule 1 -16, Calling Ball and Pocket.  \n \nCarom Shot; Kiss Shot  \n(also see AR \u201cBank Shot\u201d)  \n \nThe terms \u201ccarom\u201d and \u201ckiss\u201d are sometimes  used interchangeably, or  described or \ninterpreted differentl y by various persons or authorities.  The point of this ruling is \nspecifically not to debate the  distinctions that may be commonly argued between the \nterms , or their application to other situations such as defining procedures for calling \nshots.   The terms are addressed in the definitions sufficiently , and clearly enough to \nimpart the ir inten t within the framework of these rules.  \n \nCombination Shot  \n(also applies to 1-16, Calling Ball and Pocket ) \n(also see AR \u201cBank Shot\u201d)  \n \nGeneral Discussion:   On a combination  shot, the called ball might not be the last ball in \nthe series of balls struck or the first ball to be pocketed  in the called pocket.  In figure 10 -\n1, the player may call the 12 -ball in the corner pocket, intending to pocket  it after the \nsolid ball is pocketed first.  It is still a combination shot a s defined.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 10 -2 depicts a combination shot.  This figure is included specifically to emphasize \nthe provision of Rule 1 -16-3 that a combination shot, no matter how o bvious it may \nappear, must  be called .  If the shooter pockets the 12 -ball in Figure 10 -2 and does not call \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL \n76 \n12 \nFigure 10 -3 \n12 6 \nFigure 10 -4 the shot, the inning is ended.   \nHowever, in Figure 10-3, if the shooter in an 8-Ball game, having stripes as their \nestablished group, addresses the 12-ball, the shot would be considered obvious, and any \ncontact of the 12-ball with the solid ball would be an incidental kiss.  Even if the solid \nball falls in before, after, or at about the same time as the stripe, it will not be considered \na combination shot. \nThe number of balls left on the table or their position on the table is irrelevant to the \nrequirement to call all combinations.  In figure 10-2, it would not matter if the 10-ball and \n12-ball were the last two stripes on the table.  The requirement to call the 12-ball is still \nin effect. \nIn practice, you may protect yourself against any possible detrimental effect of Rule 1-16  \nby calling all shots that may have even a remote appearance of a combination, and \ncommunicating your intentions clearly to your opponent.   If a shot is disputed after the \nfact, the referee's judgment will be final concerning whether the shot was a combination. \nFigure 10-4 applies to Situation 1. \n1. Situation:  Player A has solids.  Player A, without calling the shot, shoots the 6-ball\ninto the 12, pocketing the 6-ball after the 12-ball.\nRuling:  Player A\u2019s inning ends. Player B accepts the table in position.  \nDiscussion: This type of shot is included in the definition of \u201cCombination\u201d, and \ntherefore must be called.   \nDouble Hit \nSee AR 1.30, \u201cDouble Hit\u201d  \nDown on the Shot \nSee Applied Ruling 1.9, Stopping Play \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL \n77 Illegal Break \nDepending on specific game rules, it is possible to have an illegal break without a foul, or \nan illegal break and a separate foul on the same shot unrelated to the illegal break. \nKick Shot \nSee AR \u201cBank Shot\u201d  \nKiss Shot \nSee AR \u201cBank Shot\u201d  \nLegal Break \nThe requirements for a legal break generally apply only to the action of the balls on the \ntable.  Depending on specific game rules, it is possible to have a legal break and a \nseparate foul on the same shot (e.g., violation of Rule 1-33 -7-d.) \nObvious Shot \nSee Applied Ruling \"Safety\", and Applied Ruling 1- 16, Calling Ball and Pocket. \nPocketed Ball \nScratch \n1. Situation:  (a) an object ball (b) the cue ball, comes to rest touching both the bed of the\ntable and one or more previously pocketed balls in a full pocket.\nRuling: (a) The referee will judge whether, if the supporting ball(s) in the full \npocket were removed, the ball would fall into the pocket or remain on the bed.  \nThe ball will then be pocketed or placed as judged and play will continue.   (b) \nscratch. \n2. Situation:   An object ball rebounds from a pocket because of a ball, piece of\nequipment, or other obstruction in the pocket, and (a) stops on the bed of the table; (b)\nlands on the floor.\nRuling: (a) the ball is not pocketed.  Play continues based on the result of the \nshot.  (b) foul, unless caused by equipment left by the opponent.  (See AR 1-3, \nUse of Equipment, Situation 4.)   \n3. Situation:   The cue ball rebounds from a pocket because of a ball, piece of equipment,\nor other obstruction in the pocket. and lands on the bed of the table.\nRuling: (a): scratch , unless caused by equipment left by the opponent.  (See AR \n1-3, Use of Equipment, Situation 4.)\nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL  \n 78 Discussion, Situations 2 and 3:  While a referee, if available, may assist in \nclearing pockets, the player is ultimately responsible for ensuring t hat pockets \nare clear of their own equipment or pocketed balls.  \n \n4. Situation:  A ball drops into a pocket and, without rebounding from the pocket, and \nthen falls to the floor because of a flaw in the pocket or ball -return system.  \n \nRuling:  The ball is pock eted.  \n \nPush Shot  \n \nDo not confuse the term \u201cPush Shot\u201d with a double hit.  They are not the same thing.   A \npush shot occurs when, intentionally or unintentionally, the cue tip rests on the cue ball \nsignificantly longer than during a normal stroke, essential ly resulting in the cue \n\u201cshoving\u201d the cue ball as opposed to \u201cstriking\u201d it.   Whether a push shot has occurred is at \nthe sole judgment of the referee.  \n \nSafety  (also \u201cObvious Shot \u201d, 1-17 Calling a Safety)  \n \nGeneral Discussion:  The definition of \" safety\u201d, and safety play in general, is  affected by \nissues similar to the ones discussed in the Applied Ruling for \u201cCombination\u201d .  The most \ncommon issue is the possible conflict between the \"undeclared\" safety that results in a \npocketed ball and whether or not the shot was obvious.   By \"undeclared\" safety, we mean \na shot in which the player does not intend to pocket a ball yet does not declare a safety, \nwhich many players frequently do when playing what they perceive as simple defensive \nshots.    \n \nThere a re no diagrams for this discussion because there are count less possibilities.  The \nproblem occurs when a player, successfully attempting to play defensively and leaving \nthe cue ball in a difficult  position, also unintentionally  pockets a legal object ball on the \nsame shot.  The player had no idea the ball was going to be pocketed, and so did not \ndeclare a safety.  Neither player wants to shoot from the resulting difficult  position of the \ncue ball, so a dispute ensues about whether or not the pocketed ball c ould h ave been \nconsidered obvious . \n \nIn many situations like this, the unintentionally pocketed ball is the result of a  shot that is \ndefined as not obvious.  Such shots  do not apply to this discussion  because they must  be \ncalled, so the issue cannot arise.   If no call  is made  befor e such a shot  and a ball is \npocketed , the shooter is prohibited from continuing by rule .   \n \nHowever, it is possible that a situation  may arise in which the pocketed ball is the result \nof shot that falls under either subsection (d) or (e) of the definition of \u201cObvious Ball\u201d.  In \nthose situations, the referee is the sole judge of  whether the shot was obvious, and \ntherefore whether the shooter must continue (in the case of an \u201cobvious shot\u201d ruling), or \nwhether the incoming player must accept the table  in position  (in the case of a \u201cnot \nobvious\u201d shot ruling.)  \n \nIn this situation, the shooter's opponent  may not necessarily  use the provision of Rule 1 -\nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL \n79 16-2 to argue that a shot was obvious under the framework of the safety rules simply \nbecause they did not question the shot before it occurred.  That is not within the intent of \nthe rule. \nAs with combinations, there is a simple way you can protect yourself from any possible \ndetrimental effects of the safety rules: always call a safety if you do not want to shoot \nagain, and always communicate your intentions clearly and verbally to your opponent.   \nWhile it is not required by the rules to call a safety if you are playing defensively and not \nattempting to pocket a ball, and while it is true that many simple defensive shots are not \nactually \"safety\" shots as defined by the rules, there is no prohibition against declaring a \nsafety even if you do not intend to pocket a ball.  Then, if you do accidentally pocket a \nball, there will be no dispute.  Otherwise, it will be a judgment call by the referee. \nSituation 1: Player A calls a ball and pocket, and at the same time calls a safety.  Player A \ncompletes the shot as intended, pocketing the called ball. \nRuling: Player A's inning is ended.  The safety takes precedence over the called \nshot, and is enforced according to the Genera l Rules and specific game rules."

    "content": "GENERAL RULES \n1-1 Player Responsibility \nSee Applied Ruling 1-45, Unsportsmanlike Conduct \n1-2 Acceptance of Provided Equipment \nIn the event of sub-standard equipment, play might not be stopped or delayed unless \nconditions are severe.  Particularly in tournament play, or other circumstances when time \nis limited, a match may be required to begin or continue on equipment such as a dirty or \nunlevel table.  The final decision whether to start or continue play is solely at the \njudgment of the referee or Administrative Authority. I f play continues, the \nAdministrative Authority should make their best effort to correct the problem as soon a s \npossible. \n1. Situation: Player A, preparing to shoot a ball along the cushions and across the mouth\nof a side pocket, either pushes on the tip of the cushion or manipulates the cloth at the tip\nof the cushion at the side pocket.\nRuling: Foul, regardless of whether or not Player A attempts a shot. \n2. Situation: Player A, preparing to shoot, notices that the table spot is coming loose from\nthe cloth and, being in the line of their shot, may affect the shot.  Player A: (a) without\nconsulting a referee or their opponent, removes the spot before shooting; (b) requests a\nreferee to remove or replace the spot.\nRuling: (a) - Foul, regardless of whether or not Player A attempts the shot; (b) \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL  \n 80 the referee will, at a minimum, remove the spot , and replace it if pos sible in a \nmanner that does not delay the game unnecessarily.  \n \nDiscussion:  If requested, t he referee will immediately address and correct the \ncondition if possible, subject to time restraints and equipment availability as \ndetermined by the Administrative A uthority of the event.  \n \nIt is not necessarily reasonable to expect that a player should be responsib le for \nan in-depth knowledge of every detail of the p rovided equipment.  C ertain \nflaws or defects in the equipment may escape notice until they are likely t o \naffect a specific situation.  If it is reasonable to expect that  the problem  would \nbe corrected if found before a game commenced, then it  should be correc ted \nduring the course of a game, time and resources permitting.  \n \nHowever, players are still bound by  the procedural requirement to gain the \npermission of a referee or event official before making an alteration.  If a player \nperforms any act altering the provided equipment without such permission, it is \na foul.  \n \n1-3 Use of Equipment  \n \nRule 1-3-1-c: Instan ces have been documented in which chalk that appears to closely \nmatch the color of the cloth actually appears as a contrasting color when it comes off on \nthe cloth.  Chalk proven to cause this problem may be prohibited despite the in itial \nappearance of compatibility.  \n \n1. Situation:  Player A lays their cue on the table to help line up a shot, then uses a second \ncue, a mechanical bridge, or other equipment  to assist as well  \n \nRuling:  Foul.  Only a single cue, held in the hand or not, may  be used.  \n \n2. Situation:  Player A, attempting to gain additional reach, partially unscrews their \njointed cue in order to lengthen it.  \n \nRuling:  Legal    \n \n3. Situation:  Player A, preparing to shoot a jump shot, unscrews the extended butt from \ntheir jump -break  cue and places it in a pocket.  They then forget that the butt is in the \npocket and leave it there after their inning.  Player B shoots and a ball (a) rebounds from \nthe pocket ; (b) is pocketed despite the presence of the butt.  \n \nRuling:  (a) foul on Player A; (b) The result of the shot stands and the game \ncontinues.  \n \nDiscussion:  With the exception of chalk left on the rail, if equipment used by a \nplayer and left at the table directly interfere s with their opponent\u2019s shot,  it is a \nfoul on the player that left the equipment.   If a player leaves equipment at the \ntable and it is discovered before it interferes with the game, or if it interacts \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL \n81 with the balls during a shot without causing a disadvantage to the opponent, it \nshall be removed without penalty, but a warning may be issued. \n4. Situation: Player A shoots and a ball leaves the bed of the table, strikes a piece of\nPlayer B's personal chalk that they left on the rail, and falls back on the bed of the table.\nRuling: Foul. \nDiscussion: Personal chalk left on a rail is an exception to the responsibility \nprinciple of Rule 1-3-1 as applied in Situation 3 above.   Personal chalk is \nconsidered a hazard for the shooter regardless of ownership. \n5.Situation: Player A, with ball in hand, places the cue ball very close to two object balls\nthat are near each other, one legal and one illegal.  Player A then picks up the cue ball\nand re-places it in a different position before shooting toward the same object balls.\nPlayer B calls a foul for measuri ng.\nRuling: Whether Player A attempted a measurement is determined by the \nreferee's judgment.   The referee must carefully consider the position of the \ntable and information gathered from the players concerning Player A\u2019s actions.  \n6. Situation: Player A uses markings, inlays or rings on their cue, their finger, or a piece\nof chalk to measure a gap between two balls or between a ball and a cushion.\nRuling: Foul.  Violation of Rule 1-3-g. \n7. Situation: Player A aligns a bank shot or kick shot by using their cue or hands to judge\nthe distance between a ball and pocket, ball and cushion, or between balls.\nRuling: Legal under 1-3-f.  The prohibition on measuring under Rule 1-3-g \napplies specifically to whether or not a ball will pass through a gap. However, \nin measuring for banks or kicks, the only device that may be used (in addition \nto your hands) is a single cue (Situation 1 applies). \n8. Situation: Player A places a mark on their ferrule or other part of the cue in order to\nkeep the cue aligned a certain way for every shot.\nRuling: Legal. \n1-4 Cue Requirements; \n1-11 Time-Out \n1. Situation: After a match begins, a player wishes to borrow or purchase a cue or other\nequipment for use in their match.\nRuling: A match may not be delayed to borrow or buy equipment.  A player \nmay borrow equipment from someone in the immediate vicinity of the table, \nbut may leave the area to borrow or purchase equipment only during an \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL  \n 82 authorized time -out. \n \n2. Situa tion: Player B questions the legality of Player A's cue and summons a referee  (a) \nbefore Player A has used the cue to execute a shot; (b) after Player A has used the cue to \nexecute a shot.  In both cases (a) and (b), the referee determines that the cue is illegal.  \n \nRuling:  (a) No foul, but the cue must b e removed from play; (b) Foul.  \n \n1-5 Starting Time of Match;  \n1-11 Time -Out \n \n\"Present at the table\"  mean s in the immediate vicinity of the actual table or tables to \nwhich the match is assigned.  While that may be taken to include the area immediately \noutside the rails, seating,  or other barriers defining the players' area, not much leeway \nwill be granted.  For instance: j ust entering the doors of the room that are a con siderable \ndistance away and then hurrying  to get to the assigned table does not constitute presence \nat the table.  \n \nIf there is confusion over an administrative issue or if a player has been summoned by a \nTournament Director or their representative, the pre sence of the player at the tournament \ndesk may be sufficient.  All cases involving presence at the table are decided at the sole \ndiscretion of the referee or Tournament Director.  \n \n1-7 Beginning and End of Game or Match;  \n1-38 Ball in Hand Placement  \n \n1. Situation:  Player A, with ball in hand and preparing to break with the cue ball resting \nin the kitchen, adjusts t he position of the cue ball  very slightly with a motion of the cue  \nthat meets the definition of \u201cLegal S troke\u201d.  \n \nRuling:  Foul.  \n \nDiscussion:  Placeme nt of the cue ball in preparation for a break shot is no \ndifferent from placement any other time that yo u have ball in hand.  Rule 1 -38-\n1 applies.   (For 8 -Ball, a lso see Applied Ruling 2 -3 Situation 1. ) \n \n1-8 No Practice Allowed During Match  \n \n1. Situation:  During a match,  Player A  approaches an unused table on which there are \nsome obj ect balls and a cue ball .  Player A then (a) assumes a normal stance and bridge \nand shoots the cue ball directly into a pocket; (b) without assuming a norma l stance or \nforming a bridge, uses a forward stroke motio n to tap an object ball , contacting the ball \nwith the tip of the cue and rolling it a few inches.  \n \nRuling:  (a) and (b): F oul. \nDiscussion:  Any forward stroke motion that includes the tip contacting an y ball \nwill be considered a shot, regardless of whether or not a shooting stance or \nbridge is used, or whether or not the ball contacted is a cue ball or an object \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL \n83 ball.  Simply put, if the act would be considered a stroke or shot during the \ncourse of a game, it will be considered a practice stroke or shot as well.   \nExceptions: see Situation 2. \n2. Situation: Between games of a match, and on the same table as the match is being\nplayed on, it is Player A's turn to break.  Player A uses a cue to push balls left over from\nthe previous game down to the foot of the table, contacting the balls with the cue tip in a\nforward stroke motion.\nRuling: Legal, provided there is no indication that Player A is attempting to \npractice or gain knowledge about the table with the strokes.  While not \nencouraged, moving balls to the opposite end of the table for racking is \nconsidered an exception to Rule 1-8.  \nTeam play: In team play, the timing of a foul issued because of practice by a player not \nactually  playing  a game  at the time of the offense  is dependent  on the arrival  of the \nreferee  at the tables  involved  in the match.   If the referee  verifies  that practice  has \noccurred, they will proceed to the tables the match is being played on and suspend play \non all tables regardless of the progress of any game (Rule 1-8-3-b applies).  The penalties \nfor the foul shall then immediately be applied to all tables. \nIf a table  is between  games  when  play  is suspended,  no penalty  will  be applied  to that \ntable.   If all tables  are between  games,  no penalty  is applied  on the first  offense  but a \nwarning will be issued to the offending  team\u2019s captain.  For second and subsequent \noffenses,  if any table  is between  games  when  the penalty  is applied  then the offended \nteam will be: \na.awarded the option to break if it is not their turn to break;\nb.awarded ball in hand on the first shot after the break if it is their turn to\nbreak.   The penalty is not applied if there is a foul on the break\n1-9 Stopping Play;\n1-10 Suspended Play\n1-16 Calling Ball and Pocket\n1-42 Non-Shooting Player Requirement \nAlso Definition: \u201cDown on the Shot\u201d  \nGeneral Discussion:   When requesting that a player at the table stop shooting, or when \nrequesting information concerning what shot is being played, requests should be made as \nsoon as possible.  While Rules 1-9-1 and 1- 16-2 specify that questions must be asked \nprior to a player being down on a shot, situations may arise in which it is not apparent \nwhat the shooter intends to do before they start to go down on the shot. \nRemember that, by definition, \"down on the shot\" means having settled completely into a \nshooting position with a bridge established and pre-shot practice strokes, if any, imminent \nor in progress.  While the player\u2019s shooting style will be considered, simply leaning over \nthe table and placing the bridge hand on the bed does not necessarily constitute being \ndown on a shot. \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL \n84 In particular, a normally quick shooter may not use their style as an excuse to circumvent \ntheir opponent\u2019s right to obtain information.  Players that choose to use a style that has \nlittle or no pre-shot routine, or a style that has no warm-up stroke motions, must take \nextra care to either communicate their intentions to their opponent or allow their \nopponent sufficient time to ask questions or summon a referee. \nIn no case may a shooter, regardless of their style of play, intentionally try to get down on \na shot quickly in an attempt to prevent an opponent from asking a question or stopping \nplay.  It is also not permissible to lead the non-shooter to believe that you intend to play \none shot, then quickly adjust and play a different shot without giving them time to request \ninformation or stop play.  Either of those situations may be treated as Unsportsmanlike \nConduct. \nIf a shooter has just leaned over the table to assume a shooting position but has not yet \nfirmly established the position and started or prepared to start practice strokes, it is still \npermissible to stop play.  At the same time, to help prevent that situation from occurring , \nwhen in the chair you must make a reasonable effort to remain alert and to anticipate \nsituations in which you may want to stop play or request information, and do so before \nthe shooter starts to go down on the shot. \nIf you wish to stop play in order to summon a referee, you must clearly let your opponent \nknow and ensure that your opponent acknowledges your request.  If, during your \nopponent's turn, you leave the table or area to summon a referee without first stopping \nplay, your opponent may continue to shoot without penalty. \nThorough and clear communication is required of all players.  If a dispute arises, or if \nplayers have persistent problems regarding this issue during a match, the referee will be \nthe sole judge of what remedies or penalties shall be imposed, and both players may be \nsubject to unsportsmanlike conduct warnings or penalties. \nViolations involving shooting while play is stopped or suspended do not require that the \nstroke or shot take place on the table on which the suspension is in effect.  A stroke or \nshot on any table at the event venue is illegal under Rules 1-9 and 1-10. \nDuring extended stoppages or suspensions caused by unusual circumstances (e.g., loss of \npower or equipment failure,) referees or event officials may temporarily suspend Rule 1-\n8 at their discretion and allow players to practice during the delay. \n1. Situation: Player A is completely down on the shot with a bridge established.   As\nPlayer A is preparing to shoot, Player B requests a stoppage.  Player A attempts to halt\ntheir shot, but contacts the cue ball.  The resulting action of the balls would normally\nconstitute a foul.\nRuling: Foul on Player B.  Player A accepts the object balls in position. \nDiscussion:   This situation is an exception to the principle that a foul by one \nplayer can override an earlier foul in the same inning (see Applied  Ruling 1-24  \nSituation 1).  The result of Player A's action was directly caused by Player B's \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL \n85 untimely interruption, and the shot that would have been a foul does not \noverride the foul by Player B. \n2. Situation: Player A calls a shot and Player B requests that play be stopped so a referee\nmay be called.  While waiting for a referee, Player A decides to play a different shot, and\nshoots without the permission of Player B or the referee.\nRuling: Foul on Player A.  Even if the shot is changed, once play has stopped \nPlayer A must receive permission from either a referee or Player B to shoot. \n1-10 Suspended Play \nSee AR 1-9, Stopping Play \n1-11 Time-Out \nSee AR 1-4, Cue Requirements, and AR 1-5, Starting Time of Match. \n1-13 Breaking Subsequent Games of a Match  \nGeneral Discussion: It is your responsibility to know when it is your turn to break.  If the \nincorrect player breaks a game and the error is discovered before the game is completed, \nthe game will be re-racked with the proper player breaking.  If the error is not discovered \nuntil after the game is completed then the results of the game are final. \nWhen the procedure for breaking subsequent games of a match calls for alternating \nbreaks, if the incorrect player breaks a game and the error is discovered after the game is \ncompleted, the original order of the break in the following games shall remain as if no \nerror had occurred. \nThe winner of the lag decides who breaks the first game of the match.  In subsequent \ngames, the break must follow the procedure required by either specific game rules or \nevent regulations.  You may not voluntarily pass the break to your opponent.   \nIntentionally executing an illegal break in order to avoid breaking will be penalized as \nUnsportsmanlike Conduct. \n1-14 Racking Procedures  \nTo ensure play is not delayed, an undue amount of time shall not be spent attempting to \nput out a perfect rack if the apex ball will not stay exactly on the foot spot.  If the apex \nball consistently shifts slightly when attempting to rack, it is permissible to adjust the \nposition of the remaining balls to match the position of the settled apex ball. \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL  \n 86 1-15 Shot Clock Procedures  \n(also see AR 9 -4, Calling Fouls)  \n \nGeneral Discussion:  The shot clock  procedures for CSI play are designed to ensure \naccelerated play if the Administrative Authority  deems it  necessary.  Referees will \nobserve matches and provide advice to the Administrative Authority, but they will not \nnormally place a match on a shot clock on their own unless they have judged that a player \nis delaying a match in an unsportsmanlike man ner. \n \nExperience clearly shows that complaints from players are most always the result of a \nclash of styles between a speedy player and a deliberate player, which does not justify \nplacing a match on a shot clock.  Historically, when referees observe player s accused of \nplaying slowly, it is rare for the average  shot time of the \u201cslow\u201d player to exceed 45 \nseconds .  You are not encouraged to  pursue relief from a referee unless circumstances are \nsevere.  \n \nWhen a player is down on the shot at the ten -second mark,  the pause in the shot clock is \nintended to allow the player to complete their normal sho oting routine  without fear of \nhaving a foul announcement made as they are preparing to execute the stroke.  The pause \nis not intended to give the player an extended am ount of time to continue studying the \ntable.  If the referee judges that a player is abusing the pause in order to gain a n unfair \nadvantage with respect to studying the table or making decisions, the referee may \nannounce \"ten\" at their discretion and the s hot clock will resume  as provided for in  Rule \n1-15-3-c. \n \n1.  Situation:  After having announced \u201cten\u201d t he timekeeper calls \"f oul\" just as Player A  is \nmoving the cue forward on a shot, and the cue tip does not contact the cue ball before the \nfoul is called.   The player cannot stop the cue in time to keep the shot from occurring.   \n \nRuling:  Foul.  Player B  accep ts the object balls in position.  \n \n1-16 Calling Ball and Pocket  \nalso applies to definition of \u201c Obvious Shot \u201d \n(also see AR 1-9, Stopping Play , and AR \u201cCo mbination Shot\u201d ) \n \nTerms:   When the term \"call\" or \"calling\" is used in the rules or Applied Rulings, it refers \nto the act of a player explicitly communicating their intentions to their opponent, either \nverbally or by gesture, for the purpose of calling a s hot defined as not obvious.  Likewise, \na reference to \"not calling\", \"without calling\" or 'did not call\", indicates that the player \ndid not explicitly communicate their intentions before a shot defined as not obvious.  \n \nReferee's presence : When a referee is at the table, they assume the duties and \nresponsibilities of the non -shooting player, and any statement made by the shooter and \nheard by the referee, such as callin g a shot, shall be considered sufficient notification to \nthe non-shooting player .  For shots other than those defined as not obvious, if a referee at \na table is satisfied that the intended shot is made, the referees judgment takes precedence \nover any doubt  that the player in the chair may have.  \n \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL \n87 \n5 \nC3 B \nFigure 10 -5 A 2 \n7 C1 \n3 \nC 3 C2 \nC2 Figure 10-5 applies to the following situations.  Multiple shots are represented.  In all \ncases, Player A is shooting and all object balls are legal balls. \n1. Situation: Player A, with the cue ball at position C1, addresses the shot to pocket the 2-\nball in pocket A.  Both players consider the shot obvious.  Player A misses the direct shot\nand the 2-ball travels four cushions around the table, returning to be pocketed in A.\nRuling:  Legal.  Player A's inning continues.  Rule 1-1 6-8 applies. \n2. Situation: Player A, with the cue ball at position C2, addresses the shot intending to\nplay a combination shot and calls the 7-ball in pocket C.  Player B acknowledges the call.\nThe 3-ball misses the 7-ball entirely, but the cue ball follows behind and contacts the 7-\nball, pocketing it in C.\nRuling: Legal.  Player A's inning continues.  The fact that the combination was \nnot completed as intended is overridden by the fact that the called ball was \nmade in the called pocket. \n3. Situation: Player A, with the cue ball at position C3, addresses the shot to pocket the 5-\nball in pocket B.  Both players consider the shot obvious.  The 5-ball rattles in the jaws of\npocket B and stops, after which the cue ball follows behind it and pockets it into Pocket\nB.\nRuling: Legal.  Player A's inning continues.  Incidental contact under Rule 1-\n16-1. \nNote:  The rulings and principles for Situations 1 and 3 do not apply to Bank Pool, in \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL \n88 Figure 10 -6 which the specific number of rails to be contacted must be designated in advance and \nincidental kisses are not permitted. \n4. Situation : (Material moved to Rule 1- 17-2.)\n1-19 Legal Shot  \n(also see 1-49, Balls Settling or Moving) \n1. Situation: Player A mistakes an object ball for the cue ball and shoots with the object\nball unintentionally acting as the cue ball.\nRuling: Foul .  Player B accepts the object balls in position. \n2. Situation: Player A shoots and the intended object ball rebounds from the pocket.\nNeither the cue ball nor any other ball contacts a cushion or is pocketed.\nRuling: the ball is not pocketed, but the shot is legal.  For meeting the \nrequirements of Rule 1-19 -1-b, any ball that rebounds fr om a pocket is \nconsidered to have contacted a cushion. \n3. Situation: Player A shoots and the intended object ball comes to rest within the mouth\nof a pocket but without contacting a cushion.   The edge of the ball is past the nose of one\nor both cushions (Figure 10-6) .  Neither the cue ball nor any other ball contacts a cushion\nor is pocketed.\nRuling: Foul.   The edge of a ball coming to rest past the nose of a cushion does \nnot constitute contact with the cushion. \nFigure 10-7 applies to Situation 4.  The 3-ball near pocket A has been declared frozen to \nthe cushion. \n4. Situation: Player A, with the 3-ball as a legal object ball, contacts the 3-ball, driving it\nacross the mouth of the side pocket and contacting the cushion on the other side.  Neither\nthe cue ball nor any other object ball contacts a cushion or is pocketed.\n3 \nFigure 10 -7 A \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL  \n 89  \n4 C2 6 \n1 7 C1 \n5 \nFigure 10 -9 Ruling:  Legal  shot. \n \n5. Situation:  The cue ball simultaneously contacts  a cushion and an object ball frozen to \nthat cushion .  There are no other balls or cushions contacted and no ball is pocketed.  \n \nRuling:  Legal  shot. \n \nFigure 10 -8 applies to Situation 6.  Multiple shots are represented.  The 1-ball, 4-ball and \nthe 6 -ball have been declared frozen to the cushion.  \n \n6. Situation:  (a) Player A, with the 7 -ball as a legal object ball, shoots at the 7.  The cue \nball contacts the 7 -ball, and then contacts the 1 -ball.  Neither the 7 -ball nor the 1 -ball \ncontacts any other cushion.  The cue ball does not contact a cushion.  (b) Player A, with \nthe 4 -ball as a legal object ball, shoots at the 4.  The cue ball contacts the 4 -ball, and then \ncontacts the 6 -ball.  Neither the 4 -ball nor the 6 -ball contacts any other cushion.  The cue \nball does not contact a cushion.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 10 -8 \n \nRuling:  (a) and (b) - Foul.  Since the balls were  declared frozen, the cue ball \ncontacting the m does not constitute cushion contact.   Rule 1 -19-5 applies.  \n \nFigure 10 -9 applies to Situation 7 .  The 5 -ball near pocket A has been declared frozen to \nthe cushion.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7. Situation:  Player A, with the 5 -ball as a legal object ball, contacts the 5 -ball, driving it \naway from the cushion.  Then, because of an imperfection in the table or other reason, the \n5-ball returns to the same cushion without contac ting another ball.  Neither the cue ball \nnor any other object ball contacts a cushion or is pocketed.  \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL \n90 \n10 3 \nFigure 10 -10 Ruling: Foul.  To be legal, the 5-ball must contact an object ball before \nreturning to the cushion it was frozen to at the beginning of the shot. \n1-20 Cue Ball Frozen to Object Ball or Cushion \n1-30 Double Hit \n(also see Applied Ruling, \u201cDouble Hit\u201d, and Applied Ruling 9-2 Situations 1 and 2) \nGeneral Discussion: Figure 10- 10 shows an example to demonstrate the effect of Rule 1-\n20-4. \nThe cue ball is frozen to the 10-ball, with the 3-ball close by but not frozen to the cue \nball.  Under Rule 1-20 -2, the shooter may shoot toward the 10-ball using any legal stroke, \nand by rule the contact between the cue ball and the 10-ball will be legal.  However, if the \nshooter elects to use an angle that drives the cue ball toward the 3-ball, there is a \npossibility that a violation of Rule 1-30  may occur with respect to the cue ball and 3-ball, \ncreating a double hit foul under Rule 1- 30 regardless of the legality of the initial contact \nwith the 10-ball. \nThis is only one of countless possibilities.  Care should be taken anytime another object \nball or cushion is near the frozen cue ball, as well as near the ball or cushion to which it is \nfrozen. \nWhen the cue ball is frozen to an object ball, a foul can still occur if the cue tip is kept in \ncontact with the cue ball for longer than a normal stroke, resulting in a push shot. \n1-23 Calling Fouls / Fouls Not Called \nGeneral Discussion: There is no requirement for a player that fouls to make their \nopponent aware of the foul.  Also there is no requirement  that an incoming player, before \ntaking ball in hand, confirm that a shooter has fouled. \nWhile CSI hopes that good sportsmanship and good communication prevail, situations \nwill inevitably arise in which there is a disagreement between players whether a foul was \ncommitted.  In such a situation, if the incoming player takes ball in hand without \nconsulting with their opponent, and then a referee cannot positively determine that the \nopponent did indeed foul, the incoming player has touched the cue ball with no basis to \ndo so, and will be charged with a foul.  However, the basis for the foul will be Rule 1-33 -\nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL \n91 7-a, and it will not be considered a deliberate foul under Rule 1-40 -a.\nIf a foul occurs on the last shot of a game, or if scoring errors occur at the end of a game \nor in the game count, you must call the foul or note the error before the break shot of the \nnext game has occurred.   If the foul or errors in question occur in the last game of a \nmatch, they must be noted before both players have left the playing area.  \n1-24 Multiple Fouls \n1. Situation:   Player A commits a foul during the shot.  Player B approaches the table to\ntake ball-in -hand and picks up the cue ball while the cue ball or any other ball on the\ntable is still in motion.\nRuling: Foul on Player B under Rule 1- 40-b-2 \nDiscussion: In general, if one or more fouls is committed by each player during \nthe same shot, the last foul overrides the earlier fouls and is the only foul \nenforced.  (Exception: see Applied Ruling 1-9 Situation 1). \n1-28 Jumped Balls; \n1-34 Jump and Mass\u00e9 Shots \nWhen reading and applying the rules, take care not to confuse the terms \"jumped ball\" \nand \"jump shot\".  Jumped balls are balls that leave the table in accordance with the \ndefinition as provided.  On a jump shot, neither the cue ball nor the ball it jumps over are \nproperly called \u201c jumped balls \u201d.  \n1-30 Double Hit \n1-32 Miscues \nRule 1-30 -2: The term \"fine angle\" used in Rule 1-30 -2 is often referred to in various \nother ways, including the common terms \"thinning\", \"feathering\", \"sharp cut\" or \"barely \ngrazing\".  However, when attempting to avoid a foul by complying with the provisions of \nthe rule, there is not necessarily a particular angle that will guarantee a legal shot in any \ngiven circumstance.   Whether a shot of this type is legal is affected by several factors, \nand the referee's judgment is final.   Please see the discussion at Applied Ruling 10-2 \nSituation 2 for additional information. \nGeneral Discussion, Rule 1-30 and 1- 32 \u2013 Double Hits vs. Miscues: The genera l intent of \nRule 1-30 is to regulate double hits resulting from multiple tip contacts or continuous \ncontact during the stroke, caused because of the cue ball's proximity to a nearby ball or \ncushion. \nIn that situation, however, it is also possible that an unintentional miscue may happen, \nand a double hit foul will occur during the miscue with the second contact being with the \nferrule or the shaft, as opposed to the tip. \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL \n92 A simple miscue, with no associated double hit foul as described above, has no effect on \na shot under the rules.  If there is no associated double hit, and a called ball is pocketed \ndespite a miscue, it is simply a lucky occurrence for the shooter. \n1. Situation: Player A, (a) while breaking, or (b) on a shot after the break, accidentally\ncontacts the cue ball during a practice stroke, then immediately executes a shot while the\ncue ball is still in motion or after it has come to rest.\nRuling: (a) and (b): Foul under Rule 1-30, regardless of whether the second \nstroke was deliberate or impulsive. \n1-32 Miscues \nSee AR 1-30, Double Hit \n1-33 Disturbed Balls (Cue Ball Fouls Only) \n1-40 Deliberate Foul \nAlso 1.7, Beginning and End of Game or Match \nAlso see AR 1.48, Non-Player Interference \nGeneral Discussion: The  term \"cue ball fouls only\", while a misnomer, is so commonly \nused that CSI will continue its use.  However, as the rule describes, it clearly does not \nmean that no fouls can occur if the cue ball is not involved.  The term applies to fouls \ninvolving disturbed balls under Rule 1- 33. \nThe term \u201co utcome of the shot \u201d is considered to  mean only the action of the balls on the \ntable as a result of the immediate shot, and is not related to the ending position of the \ntable or any effect the ending position may have on the desires, strategy or intentions of \nthe offended player. \nThe effect of the above statement is that, while extremely rare, it is possible that a foul \nmay be committed under Rule 1-33  that results in the offended player being left in an \nundesirable position.  However, the possibility of such an event is outweighed by the  \noffended player (in most games) having ball in hand and the strategic advantages that are \ninherent with it. \nIf it can be determined that an offending player deliberately  created a situation that was \ndetrimental to the offended player by abusing the provisions of Rule 1-33, it may be \nconsidered unsportsmanlike conduct and the offended player may be awarded a remedy \nto counteract the undesirable position. \nWhether a ball has passed through the area originally occupied by a disturbed ball is at \nthe sole judgment of the referee. \nDiscussion, Rule 1- 33-6: The \u201cgame winning ball\u201d is designated by rule in 8 -Ball, 9-Ball \nand 10-Ball.  In One Pocket and Bank Pool, a ball is designated as the game-winning ball \nif it is the last ball on the table and the shooter needs only one more ball to win the game.  \nThere is never a specific game-winning ball in 14.1 Continuous. \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL  \n 93 Figure 10 -11 \n10 3 \nInset 10 -11a C2\na C1\na  \n1. Situation : Player A accidentally moves an object ball while establishing their bridge.  \nThen, while standing up off the shot to resolve the situation, Player A again accidentally  \ntouche s or moves the same object ba ll. \n \nRuling:  The second or subsequent accidental touches on the same object ball \nare considered to be a single act.   Player B may elect options  in accordan ce \nwith Rule 1 -33-3.  Only the original position or final position of the disturbed \nball may be elect ed.  Intermediate positions between accidental movements \nmay not be elected.  \n \n2. Situation:  Player A accidentally disturbs  an object ball  and, (a) while the disturbed ball \nis still in motion  or (b) after it comes to rest , intentionally touches it or picks it up to \nreplace it  before Player B makes a decision on restoration . \n \nRuling:  Foul under Rule 1-33-3.  In (a) the disturbed ball must be restored.  In \n(b) Player B may elect to have the ball restored or placed in its disturbe d \nlocation.   \n \nFigure 10 -11 applies to Situation s 3-5.  Player A is bridging over the 3 -ball while \nshooting at the 10 -ball and disturbs the 3 -ball by accidentally contacting it with the cue \nduring the forward stroke of the shot .  Multiple outcomes are repre sented.  The inset is \ndetaile d in Figure 10 -11a. \n \n3. Situation:  The 3 -ball touches the cue ball.  \n \nRuling:  Foul under R ule 1 -33-7-c. \n \n4. Situation:  The 3 -ball does not contact the cue ball but moves along the line of the shot \nand comes to rest as indicated  in figure 10 -11a.  The cue ball moves along path C -1. \nRuling:  No foul.  Player B elects options in accordance with Ru le 1-33-3. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL \n94 3 \nBed Path of \nCue Ball  \nFigure 10 -12 Figure 10 -11a 3 \nBed Situation 4 \nending position \nof 3-ball Path of \nCue Ball  \nDiscussion: Be careful not to confuse the terms involving disturbed balls.  A \ndisturbed ball is not a ball set in motion as a result of the shot, and the area \noriginally occupied by a ball set in motion as a result of the shot is not relevant.  \nIn this situation the cue ball is not a disturbed ball.  The fact that the 3-ball \npassed through the area originally occupied by the cue ball is irrelevant.   \n5. Situation: The 3-ball does not contact the cue ball but moves along the line of the shot\nand comes to rest as indicated in figure 10- 11a.  The cue ball moves along path C-2.\nRuling: Foul.  The cue ball passed through the area originally occupied by the \ndisturbed 3-ball. \nFigure 10- 12 applies to Situation 6. \n6. Situation: While Player A is shooting, during the backwards motion of the cue\nimmediately prior to forward motion of the stroke, the cue accidentally contacts the 3-ball\nand moves it away from the cue ball as indicated.  The s hot is then executed.\nRuling: No foul.  Player B elects options in accordance with Rule 1-33 -3. \nDiscussion:   This situation is an exception to the strict interpretation of Rule 1-\n33-2 and 1- 33-4.  At the beginning of the shot, even if the cue ball is within the \narea originally occupied by the disturbed ball (\u00bc\u201d or closer), the initial motion  \nof the cue ball, away from the original position of the disturbed ball, is not to be \nconstrued as a ball set in motion passing through the area originally occupied \nby the disturbed ball.  However, if the cue ball returns to that area later in the \nshot, Rule 1-33 -4 then applies and the shot becomes a foul. \nIf the referee judges that the motion of the disturbed ball is intentional, it will \nbe considered a deliberate foul under Rule 1-40 -c. \n7. Situation:  Player A commits a foul, after which the cue ball is still on the table.\nPlayer B approaches the table and accidentally picks up an object ball, mistaking it for\nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL \n95 the cue ball.  No other ball is disturbed. \nRuling: No foul on Player B.  The object ball is restored and Player B continues \nwith ball in hand. \n8. Situation: Player A is down on a shot.  After disturbing a single ball , Player A stands\nup off the shot.  Player A does not communicate with Player B concerning the disturbed\nball.  Player B is (a) aware of the disturbed ball, but say says nothing; (b) not aware of the\ndisturbed ball.  With no action having been taken by either player concerning the\ndisturbed ball, Player A now goes down on the shot a second time and shoots.\nRuling: (a) and (b): No foul - play continues. \nDiscussion: The shooter has no obligation to notify their opponent that a ball \nhas been disturbed.  In (a), i f the shooter\u2019s opponent observes a disturbed ball \nand does not explicitly communicate their desire to restore the ball, it \nconstitutes a decision to leave the disturbed ball where it came to rest.  In (b), it \nis the responsibility of t he shooter\u2019s oppo nent to be aware of all action on the \ntable. \n9. Situation: Player A disturbs a ball and Player B opts to have it restored.  Without the\nassistance of a referee, both players discuss and agree on the position of the restored ball.\nAs Player A is preparing to shoot, either Player A or Player B decides that the restored\nposition is not accurate, and (a) requests that the position of the restored ball be changed;\n(b) moves the ball to a different position.\nRuling: (a) - The ball will remain in the first position agreed on by the players;\n(b) - foul on the player that moved the ball.\nDiscussion: Once players have agreed on a position for a restored ball, the \ndecision is final. \n10. Situation: Player A has disturbed the 7-ball before shooting, and Player B has made\ntheir decision regarding restoration.  Player A then shoots, and a ball set in motion by the\nshot contacts the 7-ball.\nRuling: No effect \u2013 play continues. \nDiscussion, Situations 9 and 10: Once a decision has been made concerning \nwhether to restore that ball then the position decided on is final and becomes \nthe original position of that ball from that point forward.   Any further \nintentional movement of the object ball is a deliberate foul under Rule 1- 40-c.  \nParticularly when restoring a ball without the assistance of a referee, players \nmust ensure that they have reached a satisfactory agreement on the restored \nposition. \n11. Situation: Player A legally pockets the game winning ball and all of the balls on the\ntable have stopped moving.  Player A then disturbs more than one object ball.\nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL  \n 96 \nFigure 10 -13 C3 1 3 \n4 \nA B C2 \nKITCHEN  C1 C4 5 Ruling:  No effect \u2013 Player A wins the game.  \n \nDiscussion:  When the balls stopped moving, the game was over.  Per Rule 1 -7-\n2 and 1 -33-1, a foul under Rule 1 -33 can only occur during a game.  \n \n1-34 Jump and Mass\u00e9 Shots  \n \nSee AR 1 -28, Jumped Balls  \n \n1-36 Shooting with Ball in Hand Behind the Head String  \n \nThe only relevant information concerning this rule is the position of the object or cue \nball, as defined by Rule 1 -35, when it makes contact  with another ball or a cushion.   That \nposition is the base of the ball.   The edges of the ball have no relevance.  \n \nFigure 10 -13 applies to the situations that follow.  Multiple cue ball positions and shots \nare represented.  Cue ball position C2 and  the 1 -ball are above the head string (behind the \nline).  The 3 -ball is below the head string (out of the kitchen).  The 5 -ball is on the head \nstring.  In all situations, Player A has cue ball in hand behind the line and all object balls \nare legal object b alls. \n \n1. Situation:  Player A shoots from position C1, contacting the 3 -ball while the cue ball is \nstill behind the line.  \n \nRuling:  Legal.  The 3 -ball is below the head string (out of the kitchen).  The \nposition of the cue ball when it strikes the 3 -ball is  not relevant.  \n \n2. Situation:  Player A shoots from position C1, contacting the 5 -ball. \n \nRuling:  Legal.  The 5 -ball is on the head string, which is not part of the kitchen.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL  \n 97  \n \n \n \n \n \n3. Situation:  Player A calls the 4 -ball in Pocket B, shoots  from position C1, contacts the \n3-ball, and then draws the cue ball back to pocket the 4 -ball. \n \n \nRuling:  Legal.  The 4 -ball was not the first ball contacted by the cue ball, and \nthe first ball contacted was below the head string (out of the kitchen).  \n \n4. Situation:  Player A calls the 4 -ball in pocket B, and then shoots from position C2 with \nextreme spin.  The cue ball contacts the side cushion at a point below the head string, and \nthen pockets the 4 -ball. \n \nRuling:  Legal.  The cue ball\u2019s contact with the fir st cushion was  below the head \nstring (out of the kitchen).  \n \n5. Situation:  Player A calls the 1 -ball in Pocket A, and then shoots from position C3, \ncutting the 1 -ball into Pocket A.  The cue ball is past the head string when it contacts  the \n1-ball. \n \nRuling:  Foul.  The 1 -ball was behind the head string and was the first ball \ncontacted by the cue ball.  The cue ball did not contact a cushion at a point \nbelow the head string before contacting the 1 -ball, nor was the cue ball's first \ncontact with a ball below th e head string.   The fact that the cue ball crossed the \nhead string before contacting the 1 -ball is irrelevant.  \n \n6. Situation:  Player A calls an object ball that is outside of the kitchen, then places the \ncue ball in position C4 and kicks at the called ball  by contac ting a cushion  behind the \nhead string first.  \n \nRuling:  Foul.  The cue ball\u2019s contact with the first cushion was behind the line \n(in the kitchen).  \n \n1-38 Ball In Hand Placement  \n(also see AR 1 -7, Beginning of Game or Match)  \n \nGeneral Discussion:   With  cue ball in hand, t he freedom to place the ball anywhere on the \ntable does not incl ude placement of the ball for the purpose of measuring a gap between \nballs, between a ball and a cushion, or in an attempt to determine whether a ball can be \ncontacted befo re another ball.  The provisions of Rule 1 -3-1-g apply to b all in hand \nplacement , and a foul may occur if any particular use, placement or motion of the cue \nball, while in hand, violates that rule .  It is not necessarily a defense against a foul for a \nplayer with ball in hand to use the cue ball in such a manner, and then claim that they \nwere considering shooting from a particular position and changed their mind.  Whether a \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL \n98 foul has occurred in such a situation is at the sole judgment of the referee. \nRule 1-38 -3:  If the referee picks up the cue ball to give it to a player for ball in hand and \ndisturbs one or more balls when doing so, they must be restored by the referee. \n1. Situation: Player A, with ball in hand, drops the cue ball into a pocket or knocks it into\na pocket before executing a stroke.\nRuling: Player A still has ball in hand. \n1-40 Deliberate Foul \n(also see AR 1-45, Unsportsmanlike Conduct) \nRule 1-40 -b:  This rule does not apply to handing or moving the cue bal l to the opponent \nafter a foul has already been committed. \nIt is common for a player to want to end their inning without disturbing the lay of the \ntable.   However, the only way to end your inning without violating Rule 1- 40-b is to \nattempt a legal stroke.   Any other action, including refusing to shoot, is a violation of \nRule 1- 40-b. \n1. Situation: Player A plays a shot that is legal in all respects.  As the cue ball is slowing\nat the end of the shot, Player A lightly taps the rail with his hand in a gesture of desire for\nthe cue ball to stop rolling.\nRuling: Legal, provided the referee judges that the tapping was not hard enough \nto interfere with the action or position of any ball on the table. \n2. Situation: Player A disturbs a ball and, either while the disturbed ball is still in motion\nor after it has come to rest and before Player B has a chance to exercise the option to\nleave it in place , touches it or picks it up in order to restore its position.\n Rulin g: Foul, but not a deliberate foul under 1-40 -d.  The proper citation is \nRule 1- 33-3.  See AR 1-33 Situation 2. \n3. Situation: Playing on a table with a ball return system.  Player A, either as the shooter\nor the non-shooting player, attempts to retrieve any ball by reaching into a pocket after\nthe ball has been pocketed but before it has entered the ball return system.\nRuling: Deliberate foul under 1- 40-d.  Exception: legal if the pocketed ball is \nstationary but has remained in the pocket because of a defect in the pocket \nlining or ball return system. \n1-41 Coaching \nIt is common for Administrative Authorities to modify or relax coaching rules during \ndoubles or team play.  It is also common to have controversies caused by that situation. \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL  \n 99 When coaching rules have been modified, you must be sure that you understand the \nmodifications and that you take care not to violate them.  \n \nBilliards -related w ritten reference material , or such material accessed through electroni c \nmeans,  may not be consulted during your match.  Exceptions: Score sheets (including \nfoul counts and any other necessary scoring information) and other match -related \nadministrative mat erial.  The CSI Rule Book  may also be consulted .  However, a match \nmay not be delayed unnecessarily to consult a rule book .  If you have a rules -related \nquestion, summon a referee for assistance.  \n \nPlayers should advise their acquaintances that will be spec tators not to make comments to \nthem concerning the game during a match, other than to provide general encouragement.  \nSpectators associated with the player put the player at risk of a coaching foul if they make \ncertain specific comments about the progress of a game or specific events of the game.  \n \n1-42 Non-Shooting Player Requirement  \n(also see AR 1 -9, Stopping Play , and AR 1 -45, Unsportsmanlike Conduct ) \n \nThe non -shooting player  has certain rights with regard to inspec ting the position of the \ntable prior to their opponent being down on a shot.  For example, checking whether the \ncue ball is frozen to an object ball, checking whether balls are frozen to a cushion, or \nwhether a ball is in or out of the kitchen are permitte d. \n \nThe non -shooting player may also inspect the position of the table for the express purpose \nof deciding whether to call a referee to watch a shot.  However, they may not inspect the \ntable simply to see whether an object ball has a clear path to a pocket  or for any other \nreason that has no bearing on the need to call  a referee.  \n \n1-43 Concession of Game  \n \nThis rule i s a natural extension of Rule 1 -44, Concession  of Match, and is designed to \nenforce good and proper sportsmanship at  the end of every game.  It is also specifically \ndesigned to acknowledge  that the game is frequently the subject of valid interests of \nspectators and media who have a reasonable expectation of viewing a complete game.  \n \nCSI requires all players to complete every game on the table, and to use extra care in \nchoosing their words and actions toward the end of a game.  If a dispute arises as to \nwhether a concession has occurred, the referee\u2019s judgment will be final.   \n \n1. Situation:  In a game of 8 -Ball, t he 8-ball is the only ball left on the table.  Player A \nshoots, misses and scratches, leaving the 8 -ball hanging on the lip of a pocket and giving \nup ball in hand to  Player B .  Player A takes their chair without saying anything.  Player B \napproaches the table, ret rieves the rack and moves the 8 -Ball to the rack in preparation \nfor racking the next game.  \n \nRuling:  Violation of  Rule 1-43-4 by Player  B.  Loss of game.  \n \n2. Situation:  In a game of 9 -Ball, Player A breaks, makes the 9 -ball and scratches.  Then: \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL \n100 (a) Player B, not realizing that Player A scratched, gathers the balls to the foot of the\ntable in preparation for racking the next game; (b) Player A, not realizing that they\nscratched, gathers the balls to the foot of the table in preparation for racking the next\ngame.\nRuling: (a) Loss of game for Player B; (b) loss of game for Player A.   Both (a) \nand (b) are violations of Rule 1-43 -4 \n1-44 Concession of Match \n1. Situation:  Players A and B are both on the hill.  Player A, having broken the final\ngame of the match with a break cue and not pocketing a ball, retires to the chair.  While\nPlayer B is at the table, Player A unscrews their break cue to put it away.\nRuling: No concession.  The cue Player A unscrewed was not their playing cue. \n1-45 Unsportsmanlike Conduct ; \nalso 1-1 , Player Responsibility and 1- 42, Non-Shooting Player Responsibility \nGeneral Discussion: Unless specifically stated otherwise, no act, failure to act, statement, \nor omission of information that would normally be legal under the rules is exempt from \nbeing penalized under Rule 1-45 if it is the judgment of a referee or other event official \nthat it was committed in an unsportsmanlike manner. \nThe situation from the above discussion of Rule 1-44, Concession of Match, will serve to \ndemonstrate the principle.  Despite the specific wording of Rule 1-44 and the Applied \nRuling that goes with it, if a referee judged that the timing, body language, relative \npositions of the players, or any other pertinent information relative to the unscrewing of \nthe break cue gave the clear overall effect of an unsportsmanlike act, the player would \nstill be subject to penalties under Rule 1- 45. \nParticular sensitivity will be applied to issues involving communication between players. \nAttempts to manipulate the rules concerning communicating and acknowledging called \nshots, safeties, or other required information will receive special scrutiny.  For instance, \nacknowledging a called shot or safety with a barely perceptible nod and then trying to \nclaim later that you did not acknowledge the call will be considered unsportsmanlike \nconduct.  It is incumbent on both players at all times to ensure that clear communication \ntakes place. \nTeam Penalties \nIn team play, unsportsmanlike conduct violations committed by team members who are  \nnot involved in a game will be penalized as team fouls.  Penalties, if applicable to play, \nwill be applied to all tables. \nPenalties for unsportsmanlike conduct violations committed by team members that are \ninvolved in a game may be applied to the player or the team, at the discretion of the \nreferee. \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL  \n 101  \n \n \nMultiple Violations  \n \nGeneral unsportsmanlike c onduct warnings and penalties will  be noted by event officials \nand records maintained  throughout the event .  Penalties specified by the rules as being \ncumulative during a match carry forward only thro ugh the match.  However, repeat ed \nwillful violations of the rules, or any current or previous pattern of misconduct, may be \nconsidered by event officials in determining penalt ies for unsportsmanlike conduct . \n \n1.  Situation:  Player A, wanting to end their inning but not wanting to disturb the lay of \nthe table, taps the cue ball with a legal stroke, moving it only slightly  and not attempting \nto complete a legal shot.  \n \nRuling:  (a) foul on Player A .  It is not Unsportsmanlike Conduct.  \n \nDiscussion :  The intentional  commission of a foul, which frequently occurs \nwhen a player executes a foul shot that gives up ball in hand but still puts t heir \nopponent at a disadvanta ge, is an ac cepted practice.   This is not a deliberate \nfoul as addressed by Rule s 1-40 and 1 -45-4.  A common example is a player, in \nan 8 -Ball game, intentionally shooting at the opponents group  in order to \npocket the  opponent\u2019s ball or move it into an unf avorable position.  Even \nthough the shooter gives up ball in hand, they hope that the resulting position of \nthe table works in their favor .  During this type of shot, the foul is contacting an \nillegal object ball first, but otherwise the shot is executed l egally, using the cue \nball and using a legal stroke.  \n \nHowever, if the shot were executed by contacting the object ball directly with \nthe cue, the foul would be penalized under Rule 1.40, with a mandatory \nwarning given (assuming only one ball was moved), and a loss of game being \nawarded on the second offense.  \n \n2.  Situation:  During a match, Player A asks Player B if it is legal to u se a certain cue  or \npiece of equipmen t.  Player  B, knowing that the cue or equipment is illegal and that it \nwould be a foul to u se it: (a) remains silent or responds \"I don't know\"; (b) gives a \nresponse that specifically or implicitly gives Player A permission to use the cue or leads \nPlayer A to believe that the cue is legal .  Player A  uses the cue  to execute a shot . \n \nRuling:  (a) foul on Player A; (b) u nsportsmanlike conduct by Player B  with \nloss of game for the first violation . \n \nDiscussion:  Player s are  not required to assist their opponents in any way .  In \n(a), Player A proceeds at their own peril, and should consult a referee if t hey \ndesire further information.  \n \nIn (b), it is willful unsportsmanlike conduct for Player B  to trap Player A into a \nfoul. \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL  \n 102  \nDuring a match, p layers committing the willful act of providing  incorrect or \nmisleading  information to their opponents are not protec ted by Rule 1 -1-2 if \ntheir opponent commits a  foul based on that information.  I n that instance , their \nopponents are relieved of th eir responsibility for knowledge of the correct \ninformation  under Rul e 1-1.  The protection of Rule 1 -1-2 is specifically \nreserved for event officials and referees.  \n \nIf you have a question concerning the rules, you should always consult a \nreferee or event official rather than your opponent.  \n \n1-46 Spotting Balls ; \n6-10 Illegally Pocketed Ball (14.1 Continuous)  \n \n1. Situation:  In 14.1 Continuous, after racking fourteen  balls to continue the game, the \nfifteenth  ball is illegally pocketed before the rack is contacted by a ball . \n \nProcedure:  The fifteenth  ball is spotted without the use of a racking device .  If \nthe 15th ball will not settle in a position that is frozen to the balls in the front \nrow of the rack of fourteen balls, there is  no consequence and the game wi ll \nproceed.  \n \n1-48 Non-Player Interference  \n1-49 Balls Settling or Moving  \n(also 1.33, Disturbed Balls ) \n \nWhen playing a shot after a position has been restored, you  are not required to attempt \nthe same shot.  \n \nFigure 10 -14 applies to Situation  1.  The 7 -ball near the corner pocket is hanging on the \nlip of the pocket and either frozen to the jaw of the cushion (A) or not frozen to the \ncushion (B).  \n \n1. Situation: Player A, with the 7 -ball as a legal object ball, shoots at the  7.  The shot is  \nconsidered obvious without contention.  The cue ball passes extremely close to the 7 -ball \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbut does not contact the 7 -ball.  Then, because of vibration  or cushion compression, t he \n7-ball falls into the corner pocket.  Figure 10 -14 7 B \nA \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL  \n 103   \nRuling:  The requirements of Rule 1 -19-1 have not been met, and the 7 -ball is \nnot legally pocketed.  The 7 -ball is considered to have fallen into the pocket by \nitself, and the provisions of Rule 1 -49-4-b  or 1 -49-4-c apply, depending on the \ncircumstances of the shot ."

Situation:  Player A , preparing to break and having placed the cue ball, ac cidentally or \nintentionally contacts the cue ball with a legal stroke motion.  Regardless of the reason \n(accidental contact, miscue or any other reason ) and regardless of how far the cue ball \nmoves, four object balls are not driven to a rail and no ball is  pocke ted. \n \nRuling:  Illegal break under Rule 2 -3-1.  Player B may elect any option under \nRule 2 -3-3.  If there is also a foul on the break, the illegal break takes \nprecedence and is enforced instead of the foul.  \n \n2.4 8-Ball Pocketed on the Break  \n \n1. Situat ion: Player A breaks and pockets the 8 -ball.  Before Player A elects an option \nunder Rule 2 -4, Player B approaches the table and : (a) picks up the cue ball; (b) gathers \nthe balls to the foot of the table  in preparation fo r a re -rack. \n \nRuling:  (a) Foul on Player B.  Player A will first make the choice to spot the 8 -\nball or re -rack.  If Player A chooses to spot the 8 -Ball, they will have ball in \nhand anywhere on the table.  (b) Loss of game for Player B  under Rule 1 -43-4. \n \nDiscussion:  In Situation 1(a), although Player A must compl ete their election \nunder Rule 2 -4 in order to continue the game, the foul on Player B occu rred \nafter the break shot had been completed, and is there fore penalized \nappropriately.  \n \n2.6 Establishing Gr oups  \n \nGeneral Discussion, 2 -6-3: If a game has ended and then the players realize they shot the \nwrong groups , the game is not replayed and the result stands.   \n \n1. Situation:  With the table open, Player A calls a safety  and pockets a stripe.  \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL  \n 104  \nRuling:  Legal shot.   Player A's inning ends.  Player B accepts the table in \nposition.  The tabl e is still open.  Under Rule 2 -6 groups cannot be established \nby a safety . \n \n2-8 Safety Play  \n2-10 Loss of Game  \n(also definition of \u201cSafety\")  \n \nIf following the advice in the Applied Ruling for \u201cSafety, \u201d care should be taken when \nshooting the 8 -ball.  In 8 -ball, any ball pocketed on a safety, whether intentional or not, is \ndefined as an illegally pocketed ball.  If you call a safety while shooting the 8 -ball and it \nis pocketed it  is a loss of game under Rule 2 -10-a. \n \n2-9 Shooting the 8 -Ball \n \nThe 8 -ball becomes your legal object ball regardless of whether the last object ball o f \nyour group is legally pocketed, illegally pocketed, or jumped.  \n \n2-11  \n3-7 \n4-10 \n6-21  \n \nIt is not necessary for the  referee to observe the three attempts by each player prior to the \nballs arriving at their position.  \n \nIf the players agree that the table is in a stalemate position, they may mutually declare a \nstalemate before each player has completed three innings and without informing a \nreferee."

    "content": "APPLIED RULINGS: REFEREES, EVENT OFFICIALS, AND \nADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY \n10-1 Authority of the CSI Referee \nGeneral Discussion, 10-1-3-c: Although such measures are rare, referees are authorized \nto specifically direct players' actions, including requiring a player to occupy a specific \nspot, such as sitting in the player's chair, or requiring a player to refrain from engaging in \nother actions, such as conversing with their opponents or teammates other than when \nnecessary. In addition to the other general encouragement concerning good \nsportsmanship that appears throughout this publication, here CSI specifically encourages \nall players to take every possible action to prevent any dispute from reaching a point that \nrequires such action. \nUse of such measures is a referee's last resort, and occurs only when players are already \nengaging in unsportsmanlike conduct and are at peril of being penalized for that conduct.  \nHowever, if the situation has reached that point and players then continue to disregard \nreferees' instructions, referees are authorized to issue further warnings and advanced \npenalties without hesitation. \n10-2 Answering Players\u2019 Questions  \nGeneral Discussion: It is common for referees to be asked questions when off-duty, or \nwhen on duty but not having been properly called to a table. \nShould th at occur, the referee will first ask the person if they or their team is involved in \na match.  If they are, the referee will advise the player to return to their match table and \nsummon an on duty referee with responsibility for that table.   If the person is not \ninvolved in a match, the referee will attempt to answer the question to the best of their \nability, or refer the player to a referee supervisor or the Administrative Authority. \nAfter having been involved in a call dealing with a particular rules issue or judgment , \nsome players will seek out other referees independently after the match in an attempt to \nfind a different opinion.   They may even do so while the match is still in progress because \nthey are a teammate or friend of the person involved in the call. \nPlayers who do so must realize that they are seeking an answer from a referee who was \nnot involved in the match, who was not at the table to make the call, and who has no way \nof knowing what the players involved in the call may have told the referee who actually \nmade the call. \nBy rule, judgment calls cannot be protested, and players in a match are offered protection \nfrom incorrect rule applications by the protest procedures established in Rule 10-5.  It is \nunsportsmanlike conduct for any person to attempt to impeach any previous decision by \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL  \n 107 trying to find a differ ent ruling during or after the match by any method other than \nestablished protest  procedures.   If a person does receive a different response,  it will n ot \noverride or affect the prior ruling.  \n \n1. Situation:  Player A, with the cue ball having been declared frozen to a legal object ball  \nor cushion , asks a referee \u201cWhat is the rule about  the cue ball being frozen to the object \nball (or cushion) \u201d or any quest ion to that effect.  \n \nProcedure:  The referee shall inform Player A that they may shoot toward the \nfrozen object ball , and  as long as they use a legal stroke then the shot will be \nlegal with respect to the cue ball and frozen object ball or cushion.  They will \nalso explain that fouls may be committed on the shot that are not related to the \nfrozen cue ball.  \n \nDiscussion : The typ e of shot described in this situation is specifically referred \nto in Rule s 1-20-2 and 1 -20-3, and therefore is required to be explained  by the \nreferee under Rule 10-2-1-b-1.  By explaining to the player that fouls may \noccur on the shot that are not related to the frozen cue ball, the referee ensures \nthat the player does not have the impression that the frozen cue ball exempts \nthem from al l fouls (foot off floor, intentional miscue, push shot, Rule 1.40 \nviolations, etc.)  \n \n2. Situation:  Same situation as above, but there is another object ball or cushion nearby .  \n(See Figure 10 -10, p. 83.)  Player A, after hearing the above response from the  referee, \nasks,  \u201cwill I foul because of the other nearby ball (or cushion)?\u201d  \n \nProcedure : The referee will state th at it is possible that a double hit foul might \noccur because of the nearby ball or cushion, but  that they cannot answer this \nspecific question  because it would constitute offering an opinion.  They will \nonly judge the result of the shot and make the call.  \n \nDiscussion: Since the situation is specifically referred to by Rule 1 -20-4, if \nasked the referee must make the shooter aware of the possibili ty of a double hit \nfoul occurring because of the nearby ball .  However, t he referee has no way of \nknowing or predicting the actual outcome of the shot, and therefore advising \nthe player would constitute offering an opinion, which is prohibited by Rule 9 -\n2-1-b-1. \n \n3. Situation:  Player A, with the cue ball close to but not frozen to a legal object ball, asks \nthe referee what angle is necessary to achieve the \u201cfine angle\u201d referred to in Rule 1 -20-2, \nor about a specific angl e at which they intend to shoot and i f it will be legal.  \nProcedure:  The referee will state they cannot answer this question because it \nwould constitute offering an opinion.  They will only judge the result of the \nshot and make the call.  The referee has no way of knowing the actual result of \nthe shot prior to its execution.  \n \nDiscussion, Situations 2 -3: When judging shots,  some factors  that cannot  necessarily be \npredicted by the referee (actual tip placement  on the cue ball , speed  of stroke , etc.) may \nOFFICIAL RULES OF CUESPORTS INTERNATIONAL  \n 108 have an effect on the  outcome of a shot.  In addition, t hose factors frequently cannot be \ndetermined prior to the actual shot, either from information provi ded by the shooter \nbefore the shot  or by the shooter\u2019s apparent intentions as displayed by their set -up for the \nshot.  However, regardless of t hose unpredictable factors that may be present, it is well \nestablished th at the legality of a shot can most always be accurately judged by carefully \nobserving the resulting behavior of the balls.  \n \nWhile it is not the intent of CSI to withhold any necessary  rules information from players, \nthat principle  must be carefully balanced by the need to not have referees advise players \non the actual execution of shots  in a competitive environment (Situation s 1 and 2  above \nexcepted).  There is also a  likelihood , becau se of the unpredictable factors  referred to \nabove , that even if a refe ree were to advise a player , a foul could  still occur regardl ess of \ninformation provided by the  referee , no matter how accurate or well intentioned .   \n \nFinally, it is not within the scop e of this document to address  the training of referees , or \nto discuss an analysis of the physics involved  in billiards , in order to provide information \nor benefit to players regarding how shots are judged and what met hods referees use.  \nPlayers who  wish to  explore such knowledge  have a wealth of information available to \nthem from various sources (e.g., the internet, instructional academies and independent \ninstructors, CSI referee training, CSI referees who will provide such information when in \nnon-competiti ve environments, etc.),  and they should avail themselves of any opportunity \nin a non -competitive environment to improve their knowledge of such subjects.  \n \n10-4 Responsibility for Multiple Tables / Referee Presiding  \nalso 1 -15, Shot Clock Procedures  \n \nDiscussion, Rule 10-3-4: Placing a match on a shot clock  does not constitute the match \nbeing presided over by a referee.  If players desire a referee to watch the details of a \nparticular shot, they must make a req uest as in any other match.  \n \n1. Situation:  After having been called to the table to watch a shot and while the player is \npreparing to shoot, the referee  observes the player accidentally kn ock a piece of chalk \nonto the bed of the table.  The pla yer is unaware that the chalk is  on the bed.  \n  \nProcedure:  The referee shall not alert the player or move the chalk.  To do so \ncould potentially affect  the course of the match outside of the provisions  of the \nrules.  While a match is in progress, the referee will take no action concerning \nequipment unless it is within the rules and they have been specifically asked to \ndo so by a player.  \n \n \n10-6 Soliciting Information  \n \nWhile referees are free to solicit information from any source, they are neither required \nnor specifically encouraged to consult spectators regarding judgment calls.
