 * Hook to get opponent team information and lineup status

 * Status meanings:
 * - absent: Opponent hasn't selected any players yet (lineup exists but empty)
 * - choosing: Opponent is selecting players (has at least 1 player but not locked)
 * - ready: Opponent has locked their lineup
 *
 * Note: Since lineups are auto-created by database trigger, we can't use
 * lineup ID presence to determine if opponent has "joined". Instead we check
 * if they've selected any players.
