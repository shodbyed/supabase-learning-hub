/**
 * Fetch last N games for a player (for handicap calculation)
 *
 * NEW LEAGUE-BASED LOOKUP LOGIC:
 * 1. If leagueId provided, get all games from ALL SEASONS in that league
 * 2. If < 50 games (or < 25% of limit), expand to ALL games of that game type (all leagues)
 * 3. Ordered by created_at (newest first)
 * 4. Only returns games with a winner (completed games)
 * 5. TIEBREAKER RULE: Excludes tiebreaker games where player lost
 *
 * IMPORTANT: 8-ball stats don't count for 9-ball handicaps and vice versa.
 * Players need separate handicaps for each game type.
 *
 * TIEBREAKER HANDICAP RULE:
 * - Tiebreaker wins ARE included in handicap calculation
 * - Tiebreaker losses are EXCLUDED from handicap calculation
 * - This prevents unfair penalty from anti-sandbagging rule
 *
 * PERFORMANCE: Uses denormalized game_type field for fast filtering without joins.
 * Composite indexes (player + game_type + created_at) enable optimal query performance.
 *
 * @param playerId - The player's member ID
 * @param gameType - Game type to filter ('eight_ball', 'nine_ball', 'ten_ball')
 * @param leagueId - Optional league ID to prioritize games from this league's seasons
 * @param limit - Maximum number of games to return (default: 200)
 * @returns Array of completed games where the player participated (tiebreaker losses excluded)
 * @throws Error if query fails
 *
 * @example
 * // Get 9-ball games from specific league (all seasons)
 * const games = await fetchPlayerGameHistory('player-123', 'nine_ball', 'league-456', 200);
 * const wins = games.filter(g => g.winner_player_id === 'player-123').length;
