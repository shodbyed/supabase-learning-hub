/**
 * @fileoverview TanStack Query Client Configuration
 *
 * Central configuration for TanStack Query (React Query) used throughout the application.
 * Provides default options for queries and mutations, and exports the QueryClient instance.
 *
 * Benefits:
 * - Automatic caching and deduplication of requests
 * - Background refetching to keep data fresh
 * - Optimistic updates for instant UI feedback
 * - Built-in loading and error state management
 *
 * @see https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/overview

 * - staleTime: How long data is considered fresh (5 minutes default)
 * - gcTime: How long unused data stays in cache (10 minutes)
 * - retry: Retry failed requests once before showing error
 * - refetchOnWindowFocus: Refresh data when user returns to tab
