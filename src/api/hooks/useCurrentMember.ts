/**
 * @fileoverview useCurrentMember Hook (TanStack Query Version)
 *
 * Replaces the old useCurrentMember hook with TanStack Query for automatic caching.
 * Fetches the current authenticated user's member data and caches it across the app.
 *
 * Benefits over old version:
 * - Automatic caching (fetch once, reuse everywhere)
 * - No duplicate requests (deduplication across components)
 * - Background refetching keeps data fresh
 * - Built-in loading/error states
 * - Cached for 30 minutes (configured in client.ts)
 *
 * @example
 * // In any component
 * const { data: member, isLoading, error } = useCurrentMember();
 * if (isLoading) return <LoadingState />;
 * if (error) return <ErrorState error={error} />;
 * return <div>Welcome, {member.first_name}!</div>;
