/**
 * @fileoverview Query Key Factory
 *
 * Centralized query key definitions for TanStack Query.
 * Provides type-safe, consistent query keys across the application.
 *
 * Benefits:
 * - Single source of truth for cache keys
 * - Type-safe query key access
 * - Easy invalidation patterns (e.g., invalidate all team queries)
 * - Prevents typos and inconsistencies
 *
 * Pattern:
 * - Base keys for collections: ['members'], ['teams']
 * - Specific keys for details: ['members', id], ['teams', leagueId]
 * - Hierarchical invalidation: invalidate(['teams']) clears all team queries
 *
 * @example
 * // In a query
 * useQuery({ queryKey: queryKeys.members.detail(memberId), ... })
 *
 * // Invalidate all member queries
 * queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: queryKeys.members.all })
 *
 * // Invalidate specific member
 * queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: queryKeys.members.detail(memberId) })
