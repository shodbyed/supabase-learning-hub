## 📊 Database Migrations Checklist

### ✅ Already Applied (if you ran them)

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Block User button not showing"
- Verify you're in a DM conversation (not group)
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure migration was applied

### "Permission denied when blocking"
- Run: `database/messaging/MIGRATION_messaging_fixes.sql`
- Check RLS policies are enabled

### "Group opens instead of new DM"
- Run: `database/messaging/MIGRATION_messaging_fixes.sql`
- Clear browser cache

### "Can't submit report"
- Run: `database/reporting/user_reports.sql`
- Check you're logged in
- Ensure description is 10+ characters

## 💾 Backup & Recovery

### Critical Data
Reports are designed to be **permanent** and **immutable**:
- Regular database backups recommended
- Export reports periodically for legal compliance
- Never manually delete from `user_reports` table

### Recovery
If data corruption occurs:
1. Restore from backup
2. Re-run migrations
3. Verify RLS policies
4. Test critical workflows
