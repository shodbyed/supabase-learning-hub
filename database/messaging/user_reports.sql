/**
 * @fileoverview User Reports Table Schema
 *
 * Allows users to report inappropriate messages or users to league operators.
 * Features:
 * - Report specific messages or general user behavior
 * - Category-based reporting (harassment, spam, inappropriate content, etc.)
 * - Status tracking (pending, reviewed, resolved, dismissed)
 * - Optional admin notes for resolution tracking
 * - Prevents duplicate reports (same reporter + same target)
 *
 * Reports are visible to:
 * - The reporter (their own reports)
 * - League operators (all reports in their organization)
 * - Developers (all reports)
