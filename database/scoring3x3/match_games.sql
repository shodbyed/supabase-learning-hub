/**
 * @fileoverview Match Games Table
 *
 * Stores individual game results within a 3v3 match.
 * Tracks player matchups, winners, special achievements (B&R, golden breaks),
 * and confirmation status from both teams.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - Each match has 18 regular games + up to 3 tiebreaker games
 * - Games can be played out of order
 * - Both teams must confirm each game result
 * - Special achievements always tracked: B&R (break and run), golden break (8BB/9BB)
 * - Whether golden break counts as win depends on league.golden_break_counts_as_win
 *
 * Real-time usage:
 * - Subscribe to this table filtered by match_id to watch game updates
 * - When opponent scores/confirms a game, both teams see updates in real-time
